We counted. https:\/\/t.co\/s6kMWEWXW4\n\u2014 Venmo (@venmo) September 10, 2016\n\nSince Venmo has no minimum transaction amount, it\u2019s\u00a0possible that a lot of these were just $.01 \u2013 but more than likely most were at least a dollar, meaning Sam\u2019s Venmo balance is probably looking pretty good right now.\nEven though the internet is going crazy about the brilliance of Sam\u2019s idea, it\u2019s important to note this isn\u2019t without precedent. In fact someone basically did the exact same thing three years ago. Another enterprising student also went to College Gameday\u00a0carrying\u00a0a sign with a QR code pointing to their Bitcoin address, and ended up getting $24,000 sent to him that day.\nIt seems like 3 years is how long it takes for the world to forget about this little trick, so expect to see\u00a0someone holding up a sign\u00a0during the 2019 football season asking for donations on whatever the latest payment platform happens to be.","date":"2016-09-10T23:36:26","id":1383295,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/a-kid-held-up-a-sign-with-his-venmo-id-on-espn-and-thousands-of-people-sent-him-money\/","slug":"a-kid-held-up-a-sign-with-his-venmo-id-on-espn-and-thousands-of-people-sent-him-money","tags":[36507086,2016,90475,63860,23353,30151228],"title.rendered":"A kid held up a sign with his Venmo ID on ESPN and thousands of people sent him\u00a0money","views":338202},{"index":1,"author":321129,"categories":[25515,15986864,13217,17396],"content.rendered":"This year\u2019s U.S. presidential election is confusing for everyone. The popularity contest that has become the election is diluting our time, attention and ability to think critically. Which is ironic, given that we are more connected to information than we have ever been before, and the computation necessary to model problems has never been cheaper.\nThe only certainty in the election is that the results will have a dramatic impact on all citizens, businesses and organizations around the world. With war raging across continents, inaction in the face of climate change and the disparity of wealth threatening the stability of the economy and open flow of invention, an easy solution would be to point fingers and place blame.\nWhat we really need to do is rise to the greater level of civic duty that our culture needs to govern our increasingly complex world. We need to be more involved and have an actual say in how we are governed. For that reason, I am giving my company November 8th off to remove any impediments from their ability to vote.\nI grew up in New York,\u00a0but I was born in Morocco. My grandfather, along with his brother and Allal al-Fassi, started the first political party in Morocco. I grew up admiring him as one of the founding fathers of modern politics in his country. I was raised with a real sense of civics, which I saw in action whenever we would visit Fez.\nInterestingly, Morocco was the first country to publicly recognize the United States as an official state with the ratification of the Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship in 1786. Signed by Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, it recognized Moroccan ports as open to U.S. ships and is the longest-standing unbroken treaty relationship in U.S. history.\nI am inspired by this history of diplomacy and always feel it important to be civic-minded. The commitment to make the world we live in one where countries and peoples are bound by productive relationships and trade is one of the driving forces as to why I\u2019m an entrepreneur today. These early experiences also meaningfully impacted the kind of company I founded, the type of work we do and the team we recruit to be a part of, and contribute to, our bigger vision.\nAgain, I am encouraging these core values at Enigma by declaring November 8th a mandatory holiday. True, some people can\u2019t legally vote and perhaps some will abstain, but one thing is certain \u2014 they can\u2019t come in to work.\nWhy? I am trying to remove any ounce of guilt that could be felt by a single team member for missing a meeting, a client call or any other professional activity because they wanted to vote. Most, I expect, will spend at least part of the day focused on their role in the future of American society and the world \u2014 and that\u2019s time well spent.\nI sit at an intersection of culture, identity, race and religion that made the U.S. the only place where I could earn the trust and opportunities that I have.\n\u00a0\nI feel so much gratitude to have founded a company where not only can we afford to make such decisions, but where we all feel that this is simply the right thing to do. With voter disenfranchisement issues still plaguing the citizenry, and many burdened by plight and diminishing wages, often working multiple jobs to make ends meet, we need to lead everywhere we can. We need to make a point about how important it is to care about everyone\u2019s voice in this process.\nMy biggest motivation is to respect the importance of being involved in the civic duties that are needed to protect the unique environment of the U.S. for entrepreneurs like myself. As a Muslim naturalized citizen of the U.S., married to a half-French, half-American Jewish woman with a two-year-old who holds three passports, I can assure you I sit at an intersection of culture, identity, race and religion that made the U.S. the only place where I could earn the trust and opportunities that I have. The opportunity to get a great education, the freedom from judgment by others and the support I needed to dream big \u2014 these are sanctities that I\u2019ve uniquely felt in the U.S. throughout my life. The U.S. is the only business environment where I would be able to run the company I do, the way I have.\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one; 49 percent of entrepreneurs funded by the venture capital community are first- or second-generation immigrants. Inherently, these people are risk-takers; they don\u2019t only represent the tail end of the American Dream, they\u2019re the beginning of it. They\u2019re uniquely resourceful, they get their bearings and are strong enough to build, rebuild and build again. Finally, they are grateful for the freedom and justice in the United States we have all fought so diligently to preserve and cultivate. Let\u2019s not let this election threaten the openness of our society by remaining complacent in the face of several policies rooted in fear that could threaten our growth.\n\nAt Enigma, we focus on solving operational problems with data in the real world. That puts policy and regulation in the forefront of our minds. The very least we can do is rise up to the minimum requirement of voting for our president every four years.\nThere is power in data, but it only helps us interpret the world when the point is to better it. I encourage you and your teams to join me and ensure that everyone who is entrusted with the right to vote wakes up on November 8th\u00a0ready to stand up for a society that enables ingenuity and global transformation.","date":"2016-09-10T22:00:09","id":1380178,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/why-im-giving-my-company-election-day-off\/","slug":"why-im-giving-my-company-election-day-off","tags":[5648,331649,16799],"title.rendered":"Why I\u2019m giving my company Election Day\u00a0off","views":44588},{"index":2,"author":321129,"categories":[25515,15986864,17396],"content.rendered":"With\u00a0Congress\u2019 approval ratings in the single digits, and in the midst of an ugly political season,\u00a0our\u00a0legislature might not appear as a hopeful place to start putting U.S. democracy\u00a0back on track. And shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d that depict\u00a0Congress\u00a0as sinister and conspiratorial don\u2019t help its dismal reputation. The truth is less dystopian, if not as entertaining: Congress\u00a0isn\u2019t organized enough to be devious.\nIf you look past the headlines to the slow but persistent\u00a0technological progress of\u00a0Congress, you\u2019ll see that the organization of\u00a0Congress\u00a0is changing in ways that will help it be a more informed, inclusive and effective democratic institution.\u00a0Congress\u00a0is in the process of adapting to the disruptive and data-driven demands of the 21st century. It is difficult to detect this progress on the outside, because, unlike the president and the executive branch, nobody speaks for\u00a0Congress\u00a0as a whole. The institution can\u2019t defend itself, and therefore suffers disproportionately in today\u2019s angry political discourse.\nMoving from noise to knowledge\nThe unhinged rise of social media in public life, plus the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow unlimited anonymous money into politics, has hit\u00a0our\u00a0democratic institutions at a vulnerable moment. Moreover, neither major party has made the modern institutional case for the importance of\u00a0our\u00a0first branch of government (Congress). If the political parties cared about\u00a0democracy\u00a0as much as they do about raising money, they would devote themselves to renewing\u00a0our\u00a0governing institutions and championing\u00a0Congress.\nThe Democrats would give\u00a0Congress\u00a0ways to experiment like the Brazilian Parliament, which features a hacker lab. The Republicans would be the guardians of the institution; they would insist on respectful codes of conduct and fact checking, like true conservatives.\nBoth parties would seek out best practices in other legislatures that are modernizing representative\u00a0democracy. The leadership would set aside campaigning to encourage their members to engage, experiment, learn and share on behalf of the institution. While valiant efforts exist on both sides of the aisle, helping the institution evolve in this way is not yet a high priority.\nMore obvious is\u00a0our\u00a0legislature\u2019s self-inflicted damage, primarily to its ability to engage in critical thinking. Congress\u2019 problem managing knowledge is not an accident, it is an outcome. Congress gave itself a\u00a0lobotomy in 1995, just a few years after the end of the Cold War, and on the cusp of the internet revolution. In the process, the GOP majority eliminated much of\u00a0Congress\u2019 capacity for critical thinking. The legislature\u2019s science forecasting agency (the Office of Technology Assessment) was defunded.\nSeeing public sector infrastructure as competition to the private sector, the new leadership then wiped out the shared issue caucus staff \u2014 which performed much of the continuing education on complex policy for members of both chambers and both parties. Keep in mind, these global public interests \u2014 things like hunger, disease and nuclear security \u2014 don\u2019t have strong domestic constituencies, so they can\u2019t compete with well-funded private interests or narrow advocacy tactics.\nIf the political parties cared about democracy as much as they do about raising money, they would devote themselves to renewing our governing institutions.\n\u00a0\nThe policy-relevant entities who thrived inside\u00a0Congress\u00a0after this lobotomy were ideologically aligned \u201cthink tanks\u201d that took over substantive policy tasks and K Street lobbyists who began to have more and better policy intelligence at their fingertips than\u00a0Congress\u00a0did. The GOP also cut back the committees, diminishing institutional memory by getting rid of permanent committee staff.\nFinally, the Republicans \u201cconsolidated\u201d the Congressional Research Service (CRS) \u2014\u00a0the world\u2019s premier legislative knowledge bank \u2014 to severely restrict specialized knowledge. In fact, CRS did not have a dedicated intelligence expert on staff during the 2013 Snowden revelations, having never replaced their expert when\u00a0he retired.\nWhat is the excess capacity of democracy?\nCongress\u00a0needs a democratic content strategy. Like tech innovators in Silicon Valley, citizens who want to help build a 21st\u00a0Congress\u00a0can start by thinking about how technology can tap the excess capacity of\u00a0our democracy. The\u00a0first steps for\u00a0Congress\u00a0will be organizing the knowledge of geographic constituencies so that it is trusted and relevant, and then integrated into the stodgy, old processes of lawmaking.\nWhat is a new division of labor for civics when information is participatory? What are the rules of engagement for expanded inclusion? For disclosure of conflicts of interest? What new constituencies can you offer your member of\u00a0Congress\u00a0and your senators? Are you a technologist? How about checking in with the local staff and introducing them to the hacker community.\nAre you a data nerd? Develop a micro-media press list of district-based tweeters and Facebook or blog posters who are reputable, follow it up with a meet-up to authenticate participation and determine how to create usable formats (bonus if you can match expertise to the members\u2019\u00a0committee assignments).\nAre you an events organizer? Help your member discover new ways to safely and productively engage with constituents on policy issues. Are you a community journalist? Create a dashboard together with your representative\u2019s local staff that organizes relevant information. Tailor it for the members\u2019 institutional responsibilities or for surge capacity in a crisis. Are you a low-tech online reader? Click through your member\u2019s website and contact the front office with a list of dead links.\n\u00a0\nCongress isn\u2019t organized enough to be devious.\n\u00a0\nLast year, a member office called me seeking Midwestern veterinarians with goat-herding knowledge for the Ebola hearings. Those veterinarians\u2019 minds are the excess capacity of\u00a0democracy. We need to create a decentralized decision support system for\u00a0our\u00a0legislature using this abundance \u2014 one that complements the great work of\u00a0Congress\u2019 own knowledge resources.\nHow about a question and answer site that lives through a season of hearings, maintained in the chair\u2019s district by a public university or community college? Moreover, if the committees are falling behind on Capitol Hill, let\u2019s move some of the hearings into the states so local experts and experienced constituents can weigh in. Thoughtful deliberation and learning can happen anywhere, after all.\nAcross the globe, governance is in crisis. The reputation of\u00a0democracy\u00a0is at stake.\u00a0Not just Americans, but the world\u00a0needs\u00a0our\u00a0democratic institutions to do more than survive the present chaos \u2014 we need them to thrive. How the United States moves forward to scale inclusion in the coming years counts more than usual.\nIf we can meet these changes inside of\u00a0Congress\u00a0with a helpful, ready corps of citizens, we have a chance to build a system based on\u00a021st-century power, where reputation, location, information integrity and ethical conduct are stronger than angry voices and endless money.","date":"2016-09-10T20:00:39","id":1380172,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/slowly-but-surely-congress-will-join-us-in-the-21st-century\/","slug":"slowly-but-surely-congress-will-join-us-in-the-21st-century","tags":[4308],"title.rendered":"Slowly but surely, Congress will join us in the 21st\u00a0century","views":334664},{"index":3,"author":321129,"categories":[173267257,25515,17396],"content.rendered":"Independent publishers are terrified of platform dependency these days, and for good reason: According to Parse.ly, Facebook is the No. 1 source of traffic to their sites.\nFacebook and Google together account for 65 percent of digital ad revenue, according to Pew\u2019s State of the News Media 2016\u00a0report. To put that in perspective, that\u2019s up from around 0 percent just 10 years ago. Facebook is absolutely crushing them in mobile, too, where the real user growth is \u2014 and there, it\u2019s not even close.\nThat\u2019s the reality, and it\u2019s led a lot of publishers to conclude they\u2019d be better off not competing with Facebook for eyeballs, choosing instead to forsake the exclusivity of their own properties and publish directly to the social network. Many side observers now believe we will soon witness the end of the dot-com \u2014 i.e. the wholesale migration of content away from independent publisher properties and onto Facebook.\nThe thing is, Facebook has demonstrated recently that it\u2019s willing to change its algorithm whenever it wants, and that publishers can\u2019t rely on it as a stable channel. A savior for publishers Facebook is not. Indeed, publishers\u2019\u00a0anxiety is both very real and very justified.\nHow did this happen? The obvious interpretation is that Facebook has the scale, the traffic and, thus, the leverage. But that\u2019s not all there is to it. Facebook has actually been a pioneer in finding the right way to monetize their audience without pissing it off. And this is where its recent moves against ad blocking become very, very interesting.\nFirst, it\u2019s worth reviewing what Facebook is doing right in its audience monetization strategy:\n\nFewer ads: Facebook decided to show people fewer ads and thus are able to charge more for them. They actually come out with more revenue than if they showed more ads for less money. Fewer ads also helps the user experience, thus reducing the motivation for users to block.\nNon-interruptive ads: Facebook has pioneered the non-interruptive advertising experience. Facebook literally changed the way we think about an ad, from an interruptive display unit on the right side, to an actual piece of sponsored content in-feed that looks and feels just like the non-advertising content around it.\nSafe, lean ads: Facebook doesn\u2019t let ads weigh on load times. This is a big one \u2014 and a major reason for Instant Articles. Slow page-load times on publisher properties are largely connected to the serving and tracking of ads, and the way users respond is to install ad blockers. That\u2019s particularly sensitive on mobile, where data plans are at stake.\nControllable ad experience: And now, Facebook is leading the charge in providing users with precise controls over which ads they see, and from whom. That was the part that many people missed recently, when Facebook \u201cblocked the blockers.\u201d In so doing, they also introduced precise controls for users that allow them to dictate the kinds of ads they see.\n\nFacebook is signaling to the broader advertising and publishing world that the future lies in fewer ads, more respect for consumer privacy and more deference to a user\u2019s preferences.\nMany publishers are actually making solid efforts at delivering this type of experience themselves, but such efforts are going to waste because of the \u201cbinary\u201d and unsophisticated nature of most ad blockers. By blocking all ads on all sites, these blockers treat all publishers as the lowest common denominator, throwing premium publishers (and Facebook) in with the worst-offending sites on the web \u2014 the ones that present the risk of malware, that invade privacy, that drag on load times, that ruin the user\u2019s experience.\n\nSo while many have interpreted Facebook\u2019s move to \u201cblock the blockers\u201d as a sign that Facebook is prioritizing its relationship to advertisers over users, it\u2019s actually far more subtle. Facebook is trying to find \u2014 and own \u2014 the middle ground that neither advertisers nor publishers have been able to inhabit successfully.\nOdds are that Facebook does find that middle ground. The question is whether the rest of the digital ecosystem can find it and maintain it independently. At the moment, the binary nature of ad blockers has forced each side (publishers and users) into entrenched positions that render the good faith attempts obsolete and leave the underlying causes of blocking unaddressed.\nIf publishers respond by blocking blockers, or by increasing their ad load, users will only block more. And if users continue using indiscriminate blockers, publishers will have few good choices left.\nFar from simply waging war on the blockers, Facebook is trying to carve out the only middle ground that will be left when the war is over.","date":"2016-09-10T17:00:58","id":1380159,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/facebook-isnt-just-fighting-ad-blockers-its-fighting-the-underlying-causes-of-blocking\/","slug":"facebook-isnt-just-fighting-ad-blockers-its-fighting-the-underlying-causes-of-blocking","tags":[1624938,81819],"title.rendered":"Facebook isn\u2019t just fighting ad blockers, it\u2019s fighting the underlying causes of\u00a0blocking","views":290614},{"index":4,"author":321129,"categories":[25515,3457,17396],"content.rendered":"There\u2019s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts.\nCoSchedule, Fast Company, HubSpot, ShortStack, Forbes, Hootsuite, QuickSprout and others all claim to have the\u00a0answers to such seemingly\u00a0simple\u00a0questions as \u201cWhen is the\u00a0best\u00a0time\u00a0to post on\u00a0Facebook?\u201d and \u201cHow often should you post stories on Facebook?\u201d\nHowever, many of the strategies used by publishers for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed. Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that\u00a0there\u00a0are\u00a0no\u00a0universal \u201cbest\u00a0times\u201d to\u00a0share\u00a0content on\u00a0Facebook.\nWe analyzed the median traffic that articles received from\u00a0Facebook\u00a0three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year\u2019s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn\u2019t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.\nFirstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.\n\nAs can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved\u00a0best\u00a0performance when sharing between\u00a011am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times.\n\nIt\u2019s clear\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0no\u00a0one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category \u2014 optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. One explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns.\nThe natural next question is whether\u00a0there\u00a0are country-wide\u00a0best\u00a0times for posting stories on\u00a0Facebook. Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can\u00a0there\u00a0be specific guides per country?\nWe compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before\u00a010am\u00a0they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.\n\nOverall, the sports publisher\u2019s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country,\u00a0there\u00a0are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content.\nWe also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers.\u00a0There\u00a0were still crucial differences \u2014 when one publisher experienced a peak in\u00a0share\u00a0performance at\u00a011am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing.\n\nInterestingly, there\u00a0also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at\u00a0220,000\u00a0Facebook\u00a0posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them\u00a0according\u00a0to the\u00a0time\u00a0of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local\u00a0time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.\n\nAgain,\u00a0there\u00a0are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.\nBut even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time\u00a0basis due to strong daily fluctuations. Indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance \u2014 with large social media teams and even data scientists.","date":"2016-09-10T15:00:10","id":1380155,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/whens-the-best-time-to-share-on-facebook\/","slug":"whens-the-best-time-to-share-on-facebook","tags":[449553212,81819,8103495],"title.rendered":"When\u2019s the best time to share on\u00a0Facebook?","views":51077},{"index":5,"author":521068,"categories":[24405894,15328,17396],"content.rendered":"Box CEO Aaron Levie has been at it for more than a decade.

Today, as a public company and all the responsibility that entails, it\u00a0still seems to me that he\u2019s in it to win it. He wants to continue to build his company into an enterprise powerhouse, one that can take on the biggest software companies in this space.\nHe wouldn\u2019t comment\u00a0about rumors that there have been large companies sniffing around Box\u00a0about an acquisition, but he said he\u2019s still \u00a0very much focused on being an independent company.\n\u201cI think if you look at past 3-6 months, and look at the M&A market, there is more of an appetite for tech companies, for disruptive fast-growing companies.

We\u2019ve been doing this\u00a0for over a decade, but we are so early in this mission and journey. We remain focused on staying independent\u00a0and building the company ourselves.\u201d\nIf you measured your value by stock price, you would be frustrated, but we hear from our customers and they see the value.\nPart of the problem seems to be that even after all this time, many people still don\u2019t get what Box does, yet he doesn\u2019t seem frustrated by this. He just keeps plugging away and says, while the general public and Wall Street may still have trouble identifying what he\u2019s trying to do, he doesn\u2019t let it affect his ultimate mission.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very consistent with our long-term view,\u201d Levie told me. \u201cIf you measured your value by stock price, you would be frustrated, but we hear from our customers and they see the value. That\u2019s why we build technology,\u201d he said.\n\nHe says the company is continuing to change, grow and evolve because it sees the way people work changing, and that\u2019s what keeps it interesting for him. \u201cWe were on the disruptive side for a number of years, at the same time when we look at the next decade about how companies will work, trends of today will be more broad and significant\u00a0\u2014 big data, machine learning, analytics\u00a0\u2014 much bigger tends than what drove Box in 2005.

If they don\u2019t understand, he needs to refine his message to be more clear.

Using a drag-and-drop interface, the system essentially lets you build and deploy native apps, visually. In this way, non-developers are able to create and deploy mobile apps.\nThe company originally focused on selling app development to startups but soon found that \u201ccitizen developers\u201d inside of big enterprise organizations were using the platform to make one-off apps for data collection. The company recently added a number of enterprise-ready features as a result including encrypted connections, powerful database tools, and improved GPS location management. This means that a lay user in a corporation could use the platform to track deliveries, collect insurance claims in the field, or simply create time-tracking apps.\nHistorically I have been suspect of platform approaches like this. When I first encountered these kinds of tools a few years ago, their main use was for developers to be able to build mobile apps for multiple operating systems (like iOS, Android, Blackberry) from a single logical base of business rules and then publish multiple apps simultaneously.\nNot being a hardcore developer myself, I heard different opinions from different developers at that time. More traditional developers I spoke with loved the idea and were hopeful that there could be massive time savings. Mobile developers I spoke with were pessimistic and thought the tools would be brittle and inflexible for solving true mobile solutions in native languages.\nBut Kinetise\u2019s system is far more robust than others I\u2019ve seen and honestly what interested me the most about it\u00a0were some of the outcomes the team discovered.\nIn a quick skype call with Kinetize\u2019s CEO Piotr Pawlak, he described a key\u00a0insight he and his team noticed prior to one deployment.\n\u201cWe started our product as an easy way to make native apps. We were pretty popular with startups and experimenters but we saw something really interesting: enterprises were using our product to make one-off apps,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did a little research and it looks like enterprise is following what Gartner called the \u201cCitizen Developers\u201d model: they\u2019re building internal apps instead of web pages.\u201d\nTherein lies one of Kinetise\u2019s strengths. It is a rapid development program for internal, enterprise apps.\u00a0Granted, the platform still has a way to build apps for regular public deployment in app stores too, but enterprise seems to be a major target and strength.\nI can see this advantage, as there are definitely many,\u00a0large workforces of\u00a0remote, mobile, enterprise workers out there who need mobile tools that have the ability to\u00a0function \u201coffline\u201d when network connectivity is not possible. For these scenarios, native mobile apps are a great solution and would have an advantage over mobile websites.\n\u201cKinetise is not another template-based apps creator,\u201d said Pawlak. \u201cWe are not building apps for restaurants, beauty-parlors, etc. We offer real, custom apps, but without coding. Our customers put those apps together like kids put together LEGO bricks but when they\u2019re done they have a working app on Android and iOS. No one else can say that.\u201d\nThe client responses they are getting are fueling their confidence that their approach is robust enough be a legit development tool and are aiming to disrupt the the status quo of mobile app development.\n\n\nCurrently the Warsaw-based startup has 30000 registered users,\u00a03 enterprise clients.,\u00a0100+ apps in app stores and\u00a0700+ MVPs\/prototypes\/internal apps.","date":"2016-09-10T11:58:23","id":1381128,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/app-platform-kinetise-aims-to-bring-app-building-to-the-enterprise\/","slug":"app-platform-kinetise-aims-to-bring-app-building-to-the-enterprise","tags":[],"title.rendered":"App platform Kinetise aims to bring app building to the\u00a0enterprise","views":446897},{"index":7,"author":521068,"categories":[24405894,15328,17396],"content.rendered":"When Amazon CTO Werner Vogels talks about his company\u2019s philosophy around innovation, it\u2019s probably a good idea to listen. Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has always found a way to capitalize on technology trends, whether being an early online retailer, seeing the future of cloud computing and forming Amazon Web Services, or developing\u00a0delivery drones and\u00a0commercial rockets.\nSpeaking at BoxWorks this week, Vogels says his company relies on several key\u00a0building blocks\u00a0and the \u2018Flywheel Effect\u2019 to maintain its technology edge. The Flywheel Effect is the idea that once you have your\u00a0core tech pieces in place, they have an energy of their own that drives other positive changes and innovations.\n\u201cYou have to do a lot of innovation that sits under the covers. Anything you do like this will become a flywheel and will drive innovation,\u201d he said.\nYou have to do a lot of innovation that sits under the covers. Anything you do like this will become a flywheel and will drive innovation.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built stuff nobody has built before with development process and methodologies that didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. Early on, when Amazon started AWS, the cynical wondered who would want to buy storage from a book shop. Vogels said that the idea that Amazon was a retailer, because that\u2019s what it was at first, really stuck in everyone\u2019s mind.\n\u201cWe may be a retailer, but we are a tech company at heart. When Jeff started Amazon, he didn\u2019t start it to open book shop. He was fascinated by the internet,\u201d Vogels explained.\nVogels says whatever they do at Amazon, it all starts with the customer and they work backwards from that. In practice, that means whatever they create there are five pillars supporting every move\u00a0including security,\u00a0performance,\u00a0reliability,\u00a0scalability and\u00a0cost. He says the company is continually innovating those five core services.\n\nHe says when you combine these principles with a customer-centric approach good things are going to happen. Vogels says working for Bezos, there isn\u2019t a week that goes by that he doesn\u2019t learn something. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing thinker and strategist, and an amazing visionary.\u201d\nThe biggest lesson he\u2019s learned from Bezos is that you\u00a0must\u00a0have a vision whatever you\u2019re doing. He says Bezoz describes two types of companies: missionaries\u00a0and mercenaries. \u00a0Mercenaries build products with a sale in mind, while missionaries build products because they\u00a0believe deeply in the products.\n\u201cWe are missionaries. It\u2019s\u00a0why do we do innovation, to make life better for our customers.\u201d Vogels said.","date":"2016-09-10T11:45:03","id":1382736,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/at-amazon-the-flywheel-effect-drives-innovation\/","slug":"at-amazon-the-flywheel-effect-drives-innovation","tags":[6602,144203,75968],"title.rendered":"At Amazon the Flywheel Effect drives\u00a0innovation","views":275474},{"index":8,"author":12084652,"categories":[17396,412],"content.rendered":"From Gillmor Gang Studios: The Enterprise Gang \u2014 Paul Greenberg, Esteban Kolsky, Brent Leary, Denis Pombriant, and Steve Gillmor.

Remember Occupy? Those crazy days when, giddy with the apparent success of the previous year\u2019s Arab Spring, independent, decentralized groups of protestors, connected by cell phones and social media, seized public spaces across America and\u2026\n\u2026nothing, really. In the end Occupy was a complete failure which accomplished nothing. To White\u2019s credit, he writes with brutal frankness about this, and, more generally, about how political protest as we know it \u2014 marches, speeches, slogans, \u201cclicktivism\u201d \u2014 has been completely ineffective for decades, and is growing even less so with every passing year.\n\n\nNext week is the fifth anniversary of Occupy Wall Street. That was a great buy signal. pic.twitter.com\/6FcCpewDyV\n\u2014 Eddy Elfenbein (@EddyElfenbein) September 7, 2016\n\nWhite does raise the interesting notion, though, of a new form of protest; one with an actually meaningful \u201ctheory of change\u201d; an inchoate spectre that could haunt, chill, and even overthrow Establishment capitalism as we know it. A timely subject, in this election and Brexit year.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that we live in a time of growing ambient discontent. People want political freedom and economic freedom, but there exists a widespread perception that politics are ruled by a de-facto oligarchical Establishment and economic gains are increasingly going to a small minority, as tech leads us all from Mediocristan into Extremistan.\nWill robots eat the jobs? Maybe. Sure isn\u2019t happening yet. But, to quote Bradford DeLong, the rise of AI and automation \u201cis qualitatively different from previous episodes of technological change. Will it have different consequences\u2026? How can anyone know yet?\u201d\nThe New York Times muses:\n\nBut there is another conversation happening in the valley today. Its premise is that, when it comes to populist revolt, we may have seen nothing yet \u2026 If you think globalization, immigration, trade and demographic change have contributed to displacement and political anger, wait until robots take away millions and millions of jobs, including those requiring the use of a well-trained brain.\n\nI\u2019ve argued that myself, in the past, but the lack of any actual evidence of automation-driven net job destruction now gives me pause. It may be a moot point, though. The question of whether robots will eat all the jobs is orthogonal to the question of whether people believe robots will eat all the jobs \u2014 and whether the tech industry will be viewed as the oppressors of the masses.\n\u201cI really think the pitchforks and torches are coming for us in tech,\u201d mused a member of Business Insider\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley 100\u201d to me over dinner a couple of months ago. (To his credit he\u2019d be the first to roll his eyes at the existence of such an appellation.) I\u2019ve certainly noticed, during my five years living in the Bay Area, a distinct rise in the use of \u201ctechie\u201d as an epithet.\nMy point being: it seems reasonable to expect the rise of new protests, and new kinds of protests, aimed not just at political institutions \u00e0 la Occupy; not just at injustices \u00e0 la Black Lives Matter and the current pipeline protests in North Dakota; but aimed directly at the tech industry. We\u2019ve seen some of that before, with stones thrown at Google buses, but that was really more about housing than tech. I\u2019m talking about protestors who believe that the tech industry is a greedy, exploitative, and increasingly powerful behemoth which uses its power to reify rather than repair existing social inequalities and injustices.\nI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true, on the whole, but I do think there are uncomfortable grains of truth in that accusation. As Andrew Yang of Venture for America writes in Quartz, \u201cthe only startup founders who can embrace failure are the ones privileged enough to survive it.\u201d The annual diversity reports from such wildly successful and progressive companies as Apple and Google make grim reading each year.\nCertainly the Occupy people think the perpetuation of unfair advantages is capitalism\u2019s fault, not technology\u2018s, but, er, the distinction between \u201ccapitalism\u201d and \u201cthe tech industry\u201d grows pretty fine in an era in which the world\u2019s five most valuable public companies are Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 the same five tech titans that Bruce Sterling singled out as \u201cthe Stacks\u201d some years ago.\nThe End Of Protest, after putting Occupy in (fascinating) historical context, identifies the reason that protests fail as a kind of entitled naivete \u2014 the bizarre belief that if you get a million people out onto the street demonstrating, then governments will have to respect that and change course, because it clearly represents the will of the people.\nInterestingly, a lot of what White says about protests and revolution is what tech VCs say about startup. That the real secret to success is timing: every so often, the zeitgeist will sweep you along on its tidal wave (which is actually what happened to Occupy, which quickly grew beyond its wildest initial dreams \u2014 and yet still failed.) That \u201cthe best methods of protest are unrecognized because they defy our expectations of what a protest should look like,\u201d which echoes VCs\u2019 lament that many of the best ideas sound crazy at first. That \u201cif we innovate, we win.\u201d\n(I would remiss not to note that White also writes at length about spiritual paths and spiritual process; this being anything but my area of expertise, I\u2019m going to refrain from commenting on that.)\nThere will be a certain dramatic irony if the tech industry finds itself facing protestors who adopt the very meta-algorithms of the modern tech industry: ignore history, try many different ideas even if they sound crazy, fail fast and pivot, scale sideways, accept that timing dictates success, etcetera. (Shades of the notion of left-wing accelerationism.) I think that such a future is likely, though, in the light of the heightening awareness, or at least perception, of inequalities and injustices today \u2014 and the ever more prominent role of the tech industry.","date":"2016-09-10T06:00:43","id":1382662,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/the-beginning-of-protest\/","slug":"the-beginning-of-protest","tags":[],"title.rendered":"The Beginning Of\u00a0Protest","views":373587},{"index":11,"author":321129,"categories":[25515,449162627,17396],"content.rendered":"Ask any Silicon Valley CEO what some of their biggest challenges are and you likely will hear \u201cfinding and retaining great people.\u201d Tech is booming, yet even now that valuations and financing rounds are\u00a0coming back to earth, it remains incredibly hard to attract and keep talent amid a competitive ecosystem where there are so many companies going after massive ideas.\nA few companies, however, have figured out a competitive advantage through a relatively untapped source of talent: military veterans \u2014 and the idea is starting to catch on.\nWhile the tech industry has been rapidly expanding, the U.S. has seen large numbers of military veterans returning to or looking to enter the private sector. Tech companies can\u2019t find enough skilled people, and veterans are looking for exciting careers to utilize their skills. It should be the perfect match.\nBut as I talked to a number of veterans looking for jobs in the tech industry, many were frustrated that employers often didn\u2019t know how to interpret the relevance of their skills or appreciate their capacity for such all-purpose skills as rapid learning, leadership and pure smarts.\nThat realization nearly three years ago led me to cold-call a group called\u00a0VetsinTech. I\u2019m not a military veteran myself, but I wanted to help; as a venture capitalist, I get to work with a lot of people in tech companies. At the time, VetsinTech was just a small operation with a mission to help train, connect and find jobs for military veterans wanting careers in tech.\nWhat happened next inspired all of us. Led by the indefatigable\u00a0Katherine Webster\u00a0and a host of champions from the tech community, such as\u00a0Craig Newmark\u00a0and\u00a0Craig Mullaney\u00a0(to be clear, you don\u2019t have to be named \u201cCraig\u201d to help veterans, but we don\u2019t mind the name either), VetsinTech started hosting career networking events with top tech employers. This included training workshops, mentor sessions and even hackathons to introduce to some of the most exciting tech companies across the country talented men and women who had served in our armed forces. Katherine pointed out recently that over the next five years,\u00a0approximately one million servicemen and women will return to the workforce.\nMilitary veterans are growing and, in some cases, transforming their careers at technology companies.\nWe also found that veterans make some of the best entrepreneurs. A\u00a02011 Small Business Administration (SBA) study\u00a0concluded that \u201cveterans are at least 45 percent more likely than those with no active-duty military experience to be self-employed.\u201d Mark Rockefeller, CEO and co-founder of StreetShares (and a veteran) noted that\u00a0one organization has produced more business owners than any other: the U.S. military.\nSo we ran entrepreneurship programs to mentor, educate and network veterans. We even launched a new national initiative out of a White House and Joining Forces working group that we named \u201cVetCap\u201d (capital for veterans), with a workshop program to\u00a0teach veterans where and how to raise capital for their businesses.\nA number of titans in the tech world have stepped up, such as Marc Benioff, the founder and CEO of\u00a0Salesforce. They have a great heart for helping veterans, but they\u2019re also doing it to bring exceptional people into their companies. For a while, these efforts went unnoticed, but that is changing, and a growing number of companies are seeing this competitive advantage in talent acquisition.\nLinkedIn\u00a0recently worked with VetsinTech to sponsor an employer meet-up at\u00a0Ten-X.\u00a0In May, Joining Forces, under the leadership of First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden, convened tech companies and\u00a0announced \u201c110,000 new hiring commitments\u00a0and nearly 60,000 new training commitments\u00a0for veterans and military spouses\u00a0over the next five years, primarily in the fields of aerospace, telecommunications and tech.\u201d\n\nVetsinTech and its partners, like Intuit, Salesforce, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, HPE, Ten-X and Accenture, were all in attendance to support the Joining Forces initiative.\u00a0Palo Alto Networks\u00a0and VetsinTech piloted a cybersecurity training program for veterans.\u00a0Salesforce\u00a0is running a training program for veterans called\u00a0VetForce.\u00a0Facebook has hosted a couple of hackathons for veterans, including the\u00a0first ever hackathon for female\u00a0veterans.\nOverall, VetsinTech has grown to 12 veteran-led chapters across the U.S. in just three years, and gained support from more than 20 top tech companies to hire veterans and develop training programs.\nMilitary veterans are growing and, in some cases, transforming their careers at technology companies in Silicon Valley and the rest of the country. There is more work to do, and still far too many qualified veterans looking for an opportunity. But if there\u2019s one thing the tech industry is good at, it\u2019s recognizing the power of extraordinary people, and tech companies have started to tap into a new talent source that will bolster them for the next big innovations ahead.","date":"2016-09-09T21:00:07","id":1380775,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/military-veterans-provide-a-new-competitive-advantage-for-tech-companies\/","slug":"military-veterans-provide-a-new-competitive-advantage-for-tech-companies","tags":[449553208,80962,408955,341636,449553206,1638120,449553205,449553207,104035700],"title.rendered":"Military veterans provide a new competitive advantage for tech\u00a0companies","views":113522},{"index":12,"author":83909839,"categories":[17396],"content.rendered":"Today\u2019s Stories\u00a0\n\nRaspberry Pi finally offers an official starter kit after passing 10M sales\nFord Smart Mobility acquires Chariot to boost its smart city transit plans\n\nConfirmed: Honest Company in talks to sell\nSnapchat could buy startups without raising money via new credit line\nClinton campaign and Dems get $20M from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz\n\nCredits\nWritten by: Tito Hamze, John Mannes\nHosted and edited by: Tito Hamze\nFilmed by:\u00a0Joe Zolnoski\nTeleprompter: Joe Zolnoski","date":"2016-09-09T20:38:16","id":1383122,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/crunch-report-who-will-buy-the-honest-company\/","slug":"crunch-report-who-will-buy-the-honest-company","tags":[339632284],"title.rendered":"Crunch Report | Who will buy The Honest\u00a0Company?","views":411196},{"index":13,"author":59254947,"categories":[17396],"content.rendered":"Fundraising is something all of us as entrepreneurs worry about constantly and discuss pretty much whenever we meet.\nA lot of people think you should meet for the first time with a VC or a potential investor with your pitch in hand, ready to start the process. I disagree.\nRaise Long Before You Raise\nScrap around and find a way to get warm intros early. It\u2019s like picking a partner for anything important \u2013 tapping into your network and doing your homework on who is interested in your space, who\u2019s actually insightful in the space and good to work with, means you\u2019ll have a lay of the land before you desperately need money.\nWhy would they want to meet with you? Well, figure out what you know about the industry that\u2019s interesting to them, what\u2019s intrinsic to their portfolio companies, and make that the hook. Once they understand your capabilities, you\u2019ve started the process.\nLike any relationship, it takes some care and nurturing, but it\u2019s worth it, because the relationship sets the foundation for them to take that leap of faith when you\u2019re bringing them an idea to fund. Even if they\u2019re interested in the space and the product is intriguing, the leap of faith is team x product x market.\nIt\u2019s not additive, it\u2019s multiplicative and if any of them are zero, it takes the entire equation down to zero. So, especially in this anemic macro-economic environment, it\u2019s a lot less risky for them if they feel like they already have a sense of the team.\nIf you know them before you take money from them, it\u2019s good after the money hits the bank too. You start with higher credibility and a better understanding of one another\u2019s working styles before the first board meeting. You have a more acute understanding of their beliefs around the space and there\u2019s a foundation of trust and benefit of the doubt in the face of any conflicts.\nIn short, if they know you and trust you, they\u2019ll be a lot more open to your ideas after the funding hits and a lot more likely to make that leap and write you the check in the first place. It\u2019s not rocket science, but it does take a good amount of elbow grease up front and a substantial amount of prep and time.\nFire Faster\nI have yet to hear a CEO or founder say they regret firing someone too quickly. Seriously. We have a rough rule of thumb \u2013 if there\u2019s a team member I\u2019ve had a conversation five or more times in about the span of a month (and that includes other people coming and giving feedback, me having discussions on what to do for them with co-founders, etc), we know we have a serious problem.\nThe worst thing we can do is let that problem fester. We know we either have to resolve it fast, or let the person go.\nThere are a hundred reasons we wait too long. It\u2019s the part of my job that I hate the most. I hate it so much it triggers a physical reaction for me. I know and care about every single member of our team. I know about their sick parent, their spouse that\u2019s having trouble finding a job, all of it, and I take all of it home with me.\nThe decision to let someone go is never made lightly and it always costs something emotionally. The key indicator for me is if thoughts of the situation or person come flooding in right before bed or right when I get up, I already know what needs to be done, I just don\u2019t want to do it. But that\u2019s exactly when the team needs me to suck it up and get it done for them.\nWalk and Talk\nI get 6-8 miles a day by walking during my one-to-ones and pacing during calls. Headsets are a great thing. This is most of my exercise for the week, and my doctor says I\u2019ve never been in better cardiovascular shape. Seriously, my resting heart rate is in the low 60\u2019s now!\nBut, the biggest benefit is that people feel more free to talk about the hard things if you\u2019re not sitting across the table, staring at them. If I really want to hear what someone thinks, I\u2019ll ask them to walk with me.\nNow the whole team does this with one another and it\u2019s become part of our culture. I also think people have better ideas when they\u2019re walking and the blood is flowing. I find that walking side-by-side, facing the same direction, it has the effect of making it feel more like we\u2019re solving a problem together, or that the solution or idea is ours as opposed to mine or theirs.\nThe Hidden Benefits of Your Advisory Board\nMost people think of an advisory board as just advising on functional areas along with some strategy. Of course, we\u2019ve included domain experts to help us in areas where we need it \u2013 and there are plenty of those \u2013 but there are less obvious benefits to an advisory board, too.\nThe first is recruiting. The referral aspect of this is obvious, as advisors all have their own extensive networks. The bigger bonus is having them help you close on a candidate you really want. From the candidate\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re more objective than an employee or an investor in the company. They\u2019re also a great conduit for ongoing correspondence with the candidate after you\u2019ve made the offer.\nYou can have contact with a potential hire every 24-48 hours without making them feel like someone from the company is bugging them or pressuring them to make a decision.\nThe second benefit is on the fundraising side. Every investor has people that influence their opinions and if some of your advisors happen to be those people\u2026 That they\u2019re willing to go to bat for you and support you is a massive reputational benefit, which is something that can\u2019t be overstated when you\u2019re asking a person to make that leap of faith. The third benefit is that they\u2019re usually more than happy to spread the word when you go to press, a time when it\u2019s important that all the talking doesn\u2019t come from you. You need as many different types of advocates as you can get. The right group of advisors is chomping at the bit and raring to go at press time.\nDon\u2019t Discount the Kitchen Cabinet\nThere\u2019s only one CEO but there are a lot of team members. There are days where you give and give and end up feeling a little emotionally tapped out.\nThat\u2019s where my ladies come in, my Kitchen Cabinet. It\u2019s a group of women that acts as an unofficial group of advisors. It\u2019s really a safe place where we understand each other and have permission to be be vulnerable.\nProblems become a lot less scary when you can talk them through. We\u2019re available to each other by phone pretty much anytime and we get together for slumber parties once a quarter. We spend a whole day and night just kicking back. We eat, drink, talk, and decompress. We support each other.\nThese get-togethers aren\u2019t just a couple of hours of light conversation \u2013 having a large chunk of time to relax into means you can really get into things and help each other.\nI\u2019d urge you to pick a handful of savvy, awesome, and trustworthy women you feel would gel together, kick your significant other and\/or kids out of the house for a night, and slumber party it. Spending a day and night away is big investment but it has a massive payoff from an energy and happiness perspective.","date":"2016-09-09T20:31:45","id":1382777,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/five-lessons-for-founders\/","slug":"five-lessons-for-founders","tags":[],"title.rendered":"Five lessons for\u00a0founders","views":422936},{"index":14,"author":321129,"categories":[25515,449223024,17396],"content.rendered":"Audiences around the globe enjoyed all the action of\u00a0the 2016 Summer Olympic Games thanks in large part to the drones hovering above the events (or below them), capturing every movement, from every angle. Athletes and spectators didn\u2019t give a second thought to the presence of these drones \u2014 which shows how rapidly they\u2019ve become commonplace. Indeed, drones can be found in almost every industry.\u00a0\nNot just for military or recreational use any more\nFor years, the military has used drones, which they refer to as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\/Systems (UAV\/UAS), to get a birds-eye view of complex operational missions and perform intelligence gathering. And recreational use of drones has soared, as individuals use them to take aerial photographs, explore, race, etc. (In January 2016, only 30 days after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued\u00a0a new rule\u00a0that required drones to be registered, hobbyists had registered more than 181,000 drones).\nMore recently, however, drones have come onto the radar of commercial enterprises and public sector agencies as a way to help them tap into new opportunities, improve services, increase visibility and cut costs.\nThe media and entertainment, mining, oil and gas, retail, construction, agriculture and real estate industries, among others, have already successfully put drones to work for them. City and state governments, first responders, educational and environmental agencies, etc., also have started identifying ways to use drones to enhance their capabilities and efficiencies. As a result of the many potential applications, the\u00a0Association for UAS International estimates\u00a0drones could create 100,000 jobs and generate $82 billion in economic activity over the next 10 years.\u00a0\nIsrael: The powerhouse of innovation\nGiven Israel\u2019s pioneering work with military drone technology, it is no surprise the country is the\u00a0biggest military drone exporter\u00a0in the world, supplying almost 61 percent of the drones sold since 1985. Commercial drones are a natural extension of Israel\u2019s strong defense and aerospace industries, which are led by global visionaries such as\u00a0Israel Aerospace Industries,\u00a0Elbit Systems,\u00a0Rafael\u00a0and\u00a0Aeronautics.\nIsraeli aviation, robotics, autonomous systems and computer vision experts have been taking their military experience and translating it into commercial applications that companies, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and DJI are implementing to the benefit of the overall civilian drone industry.\u00a0\nThe new frontier: Israeli startups\nAs new drone applications are identified, Israeli experts are optimally poised to deliver the military-grade capabilities needed to succeed. We, as seed investors in many of Israel\u2019s technology startups, have seen firsthand the explosion of Israeli drone companies.\nSource: YL Ventures\nIn fact, there are close to 40 Israeli commercial drone startups addressing a variety of needs for a wide range of sectors. The overwhelming majority of the companies were established in the last two to three years. Interestingly, 42 percent of these early-stage companies have secured capital, totaling $80 million.\nIn general, the Israeli commercial drone startup ecosystem can be divided into four main categories: autonomous platforms, anti-drone and cybersecurity solutions, systems and components and drone providers.\u00a0\nAutonomous platforms\nEnd-to-end autonomous platforms are the future of the commercial drone industry. They enable drones to complete activities without needing any human intervention. Israeli startups are leading the world\u2019s development of autonomous capabilities. For example, they are creating drones that deliver packages to their destination and intelligent navigation and advanced computer vision technologies that identify and circumvent potential issues.\nIsrael\u2019s deep military and defense expertise puts Israeli entrepreneurs at an advantage.\nSome of the companies to watch in this category include\u00a0Airobotics,\u00a0Flytrex,\u00a0Arbe Robotics\u00a0and\u00a0AerialGuard. Airobotics\u00a0recently emerged from stealth mode and raised a substantial amount of capital;\u00a0the company is developing an autonomous drone capable of recharging its own batteries. Flytrex offers a drone for parcel delivery that is already operating in five countries. Arbe Robotics, the winner of the\u00a0TechCrunch Tel Aviv Pitch-off Competition, and AerialGuard, the runner-up in the\u00a02016 Global Innovation Awards,\u00a0are focused on developing intelligent navigation and obstacle avoidance systems.\u00a0\nAnti-drone and cybersecurity solutions\nThere are risks created by drones that need to be mitigated. To ensure safe, appropriate usage, regulatory bodies are requiring individuals and commercial entities to register their drones. This is only a first step, however. The public needs to be protected from unregistered, \u201crogue\u201d drones, and the drones, themselves, need to be protected from hackers trying to tamper with, disrupt or, in extreme cases, take control over their operations. Israeli entrepreneurs, renowned for their defense and cybersecurity expertise, are developing systems that can intercept drones that pose a threat to public safety and prevent attacks that attempt to use a drone to carry out an exploit.\nCompanies to look at in this category include\u00a0ApolloShield,\u00a0Cybermoon\u00a0and\u00a0RegulusX.\u00a0 ApolloShield, a recent Y Combinator accelerator participant, is developing an anti-drone system capable of detecting and intercepting drones. Cybermoon offers a detection system that uses an advanced audio analytic algorithm to locate drones. RegulusX, a finalist in the\u00a02016 CYBERSTORM competition, is building a protection solution for drones that encrypts communications and detects jamming attempts to ensure the integrity of their operations and safe usage.\u00a0\nSystems and components\nVaried use cases require varied drone capabilities. To meet this market need, startups are emerging that offer different drone systems and components. The offerings can be almost anything, ranging from sensors and communication solutions to 3D mapping and drone insurance platforms.\nExamples of companies in this category include\u00a0ParaZero\u00a0and\u00a0Sensilize. ParaZero is developing a recovery system for malfunctioning drones, in the form of a parachute, and Sensilize is creating a multispectral sensor for agricultural applications.\nDrone providers\n\nSpecific drone applications have given rise to specialized drone providers that can offer solutions tailored to fit a particular industry\u2019s needs. For example, inspection drones, agricultural drones and disaster recovery drones.\nExamples of vertical drone providers include\u00a0Fitch,\u00a0Sky Sapience\u00a0and\u00a0Colugo Systems. Fitch is developing the first ever drone for fishing, Sky Sapience is creating a drone suited for security and safety applications and Colugo is designing a lightweight, low-power-consumption drone for delivery and inspection purposes.\nAll these commercial drone technologies are driving new and exciting applications. We feel Israel\u2019s deep military and defense expertise puts Israeli entrepreneurs at an advantage, giving them the highly valuable skill set needed to introduce military-grade capabilities that can grow and enhance the value of the drone market.\u00a0Thanks to Israeli innovators, we expect to see many more use cases for drones that can benefit us all.","date":"2016-09-09T20:00:00","id":1380151,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/the-drone-race-is-off-and-running-with-israel-in-the-lead\/","slug":"the-drone-race-is-off-and-running-with-israel-in-the-lead","tags":[449553182,449553185,449549793,449552427,449553181,449553175,449553180,449553178,137903,449553183,449553174,225309232,9937,449553184,446561069,449553186,449553179,449553177,449553176,4214723],"title.rendered":"The drone race is off and running, with Israel in the\u00a0lead","views":364389},{"index":15,"author":5956050,"categories":[1612,329026],"content.rendered":"Roku, the streaming media company, has netted its first deal with an operator in Asia after it announced an agreement with Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT).\nPLDT is no stranger to deals with tech companies, it invested in Rocket Internet to develop technologies for Southeast Asia and was an early backer of\u00a0Netflix-like service iFlix, which\u00a0also operates in Southeast Asia.\nNow, through its deal with Roku, PLDT will sell a dedicated, own-branded Roku streaming player and offer an accompanying\u00a0streaming service from Q2 2017.

But designer Amos Dudley has done what I\u2019ve always hoped someone would do: make a camera entirely out of 3D printed parts \u2014 yes, including the lens.\nHe used a Form 2 SLA printer, which can put out objects using a variety of resin types \u2014 a flexible one for one piece, a rigid one for another, a colored one for one piece, a clear one for another. It prints at a high enough precision (sub-millimeter) that things like small gear teeth or other interacting machine parts can be produced without the need to do lots of manual post-work knocking off pieces or sanding them down.\nThe enclosure, film sprocket, and iris are all more or less straightforward \u2014 the latter has a rather organic look from the way its resin blades slide past each other.\nFor the shutter, Dudley rejected a few common mechanically simple designs and found a solution in a camera from 1885. Two mirror image planes swoop past one another when the shutter button is pushed, moving from blocking the aperture in one position to blocking it in the other \u2014 but while they move, the way is clear. In Dudley\u2019s design, you end up having to press one shutter button to switch them one way and another to switch them back, and there are no set exposure times, but it works.\n\nThe amazing part is the lens. First Dudley worked out exactly what optical qualities he\u2019d need, simulating the parts and distances involved in a ray tracer. Then he actually printed it out using a high-quality transparent resin and sanded it down with a custom machine. Then a dip in liquid resin fills in the tiny valleys and flaws, making the lens, if not optically perfect, at least functional. It\u2019s spherical, so there\u2019s problems towards the edges of the frame, but with the aperture limited and other factors accounted for in the body of the camera, it works!\nPop a little film in there (Fujicolor Superia 400 \u2014 can\u2019t 3D print that\u2026 yet) and it\u2019s ready for its close-ups. Because it has a fixed focus, and not a very distant one.\nThe rest of the photos are in Dudley\u2019s Flickr stream.\nIt\u2019s quite an amazing accomplishment, and hopefully it will spur others with similar ideas to create similar devices of their own. Or you could just follow Dudley\u2019s process for practice; the 3D models and other specs are available here.","date":"2016-09-09T18:01:13","id":1383127,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/every-single-part-of-this-camera-is-3d-printed\/","slug":"every-single-part-of-this-camera-is-3d-printed","tags":[1334084,24595,436],"title.rendered":"Every single part of this camera is 3D\u00a0printed","views":169689},{"index":17,"author":12084669,"categories":[4328,17396],"content.rendered":"Some people might be wondering why a hashtag to do with Paypal has been blowing up on twitter in the last two days. The #PayPal4Palestine hashtag has been making waves on social media after 43 companies and organizations in Palestine published an open letter to Paypal asking for the payment platform to work there. The move came only after PayPal ignored their requests for a formal meeting.\nPayPal currently does not work for Palestinians in the West Bank or Gaza, but does work for Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal by international law. Israelis and Palestinians also all use the same currency, the Israeli Shekels. But quite how an Internet platform could work in some areas of a country but not in another \u2014 where the areas in question are are in some cases literally meters apart \u2014 is puzzling to say the least.\nThe group behind the hashtag and the letter, Americans for a Vibrant Palestinian Economy (A4VPE), ask PayPal CEO Daniel Shulman (pictured) to consider the fact that PayPal operates in 203 countries, many of which could be considered far less stable than Palestine, including Somalia and Yemen. Yemen is currently engaged in a devastating civil war, while Somalia has been war-torn for many years.\n\u201cWe have been told that PayPal is concerned about the compliance investments required to enter the Palestinian market. We believe such costs have been greatly overestimated. The U.S. Treasury Department has spent a great deal of time working with the Palestine Monetary Authority to strengthen safeguards against abuse. PayPal currently operates in over 203 countries including places with major problems of corruption and terrorism like Somalia and Yemen. We are confident that Palestine will prove a much easier place to profitably do business than these and other markets that PayPal has already entered,\u201d the group writes in the letter (which is reproduced below).\nA spokesperson for startup accelerator Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG), one of the signatories to the letter, said: \u201cGSG is a major work hub for startups and freelancers in Gaza \u2014 payments are one of the toughest issues for them. After working tirelessly to win business in the global marketplace, they then have to pay steep fees for wire transfers or foreign banks to get paid. PayPal opening here is one of the most immediately impactful moves that could be done to support the economy here. Gazans we work with can\u2019t understand why PayPal serves Israelis living in the West Bank and is open for business in counties like Yemen and Somalia, but not here. Businesses in Gaza and the West Bank just want access to the same opportunities PayPal affords to the other 200 countries and territories they serve.\u201d\nTechCrunch contacted PayPal for its response and they sent us this statement: \u201cPayPal\u2019s ambition is for everyone ultimately to have access to our services for digital payments and commerce, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  We appreciate the interest that the Palestinian community has shown in PayPal. While we do not have anything to announce for the immediate future, we continuously work to develop strategic partnerships, address business feasibility, regulatory, and compliance needs and requirements, and acquire the necessary local authority permissions for new market entries.\u201d\nPayPal has a major operation in Israel in the form of its risk team.\nPalestine produces roughly 2,000 IT graduates per year. Both the West Bank and Gaza now have a number of technology companies which, ironically, see tech as a way of developing their economy, just as the Israelis do.\nAugust 23, 2016\nMr. Daniel H. Schulman\nPresident and CEO\nPayPal\n2211 North First Street\nSan Jose, CA 95131\nDear Mr. Schulman,\nWe are writing to urge you to extend PayPal\u2019s services to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza thereby removing a major limitation on the Palestinian technology sector, one of the only bright spots in the overall economy. More importantly, extending PayPal services would resolve the current discriminatory situation whereby PayPal\u2019s payment portal can be accessed freely by Israeli settlers living illegally (per international humanitarian law) in the West Bank while it remains unavailable to the occupied Palestinian population.\nPayPal\u2019s absence is a major obstacle to the growth of Palestine\u2019s tech sector and the overall economy. While other payment portals are available, there is no replacement for the trust and familiarity that PayPal inspires among potential users, particularly those that are unfamiliar with Palestine-based companies. Without access to PayPal, Palestinian entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and others face routine difficulties in receiving payments for business and charitable purposes. Moreover, PayPal\u2019s absence is problematic for the overall Palestinian economy as tech is one of the only sectors with the potential to grow under status quo conditions of the Israeli occupation which severely restricts the internal and cross-border movement of goods and people. Indeed, by entering the Palestinian market, PayPal has the opportunity to make a significant contribution toward alleviating the destabilizing unemployment rates of over 25% in the West Bank and 40% in Gaza.\nWe have been told that PayPal is concerned about the compliance investments required to enter the Palestinian market. We believe such costs have been greatly overestimated. The U.S. Treasury Department has spent a great deal of time working with the Palestine Monetary Authority to strengthen safeguards against abuse. PayPal currently operates in over 203 countries including places with major problems of corruption and terrorism like Somalia and Yemen. We are confident that Palestine will prove a much easier place to profitably do business than these and other markets that PayPal has already entered.\nIn addition to business reasons, there are also ethical reasons for PayPal to enter the Palestinian market. PayPal\u2019s decision to launch its service in Israel for Israeli bank customers means that it inadvertently made its services freely available to Jewish settlers living illegally in the occupied West Bank. Palestinians living in close proximity to those settlers do not, however, have access as PayPal doesn\u2019t work with Palestinian banks and Palestinians are unable to establish Israeli bank accounts. We believe a company like PayPal, whose actions in North Carolina reaffirmed its commitment to equal rights, would agree that people living in the same neighborhood ought to have equal rights and access to its services regardless of religion or ethnicity.\nWe understand that entering a new market can be complex and would be more than happy to work with you, the Palestinian Monetary Authority, and any other necessary officials to pave the way for PayPal\u2019s entry to the Palestinian market.\nWe very much look forward to hearing from you and working with you to ensure that Palestinian entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and others are free to participate in global commerce.

Well, nothing: Opening a book is a critical step in finding out what\u2019s inside. Or at least it was until someone at MIT decided that shouldn\u2019t be the case.\nThe researchers combined a couple of powerful techniques to make this possible. Terahertz imaging passes through paper and cover but the radiation is also reflected differently by paper and ink, unlike longer wavelengths like x-rays.\nThen there\u2019s femtophotography, a clever way of capturing certain types of imagery just trillionths of a second apart. This lets extremely fine distinctions be made, such as whether a reflected image comes from one page or the next one a fraction of a millimeter down.\n\nThe result is terahertz femtophotography, and the researchers were able to make it determine the distance to the first 20 pages of a book, and it could pick out individual letters printed on the first 9. There was only one letter per page, but still, how well can you read through the cover?\n\u201cThe Metropolitan Museum in New York showed a lot of interest in this, because they want to, for example, look into some antique books that they don\u2019t even want to touch,\u201d said Barmak Heshmat, one of the authors of the paper, in an MIT news release.\n\nThere\u2019s much improvement to be done, perhaps combining the terahertz radiation with other frequencies. This is already done with visible and near-visible light in what\u2019s called multispectral imaging, and has discovered secrets buried beneath layers of ink on century-old manuscripts.\nThe tech could also be used on things other than books: layers of paint, for example, in a famous piece of art, or materials stacked tightly in archaeological samples.\nIt\u2019s all out of MIT\u2019s Camera Culture group. A more technical breakdown of the process can be found in this video or in the paper published today in Nature Communications.\n(Note: In my defense, I thought of the judge a book through its cover thing before I saw MIT\u2019s headline.

Consequently, the end result of basic income could be theoretically regressive in nature by reducing the benefits of the poor and transferring that revenue instead to the middle classes and the rich. Obviously a bad idea, right?\nThis new argument has been made most notably by the White House\u2019s own chief economic adviser, Jason Furman, perhaps after himself reading the words of Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).\nThe problem is that those who make this particular argument are building somewhat of a straw man, not only because of the blanket assumptions they are making around a very specific tax-neutral design, but also because they aren\u2019t publicly acknowledging just how poorly our present means-tested programs are targeted by virtue of their applied conditions, and just how unequal one dollar can be to one dollar, however counterintuitive that may seem.\nAssuming things work as we think they work is exactly one of the biggest obstacles we\u2019ve always had to improving anything.\nBasically, this particular argument would only make sense if we in no way altered our tax system to achieve UBI, and if our programs worked as we assume they work because that\u2019s how they should work. The problem is they don\u2019t work that way.\nAssuming things work as we think they work is exactly one of the biggest obstacles we\u2019ve always had to improving anything, because to fix something we first need to understand it\u2019s broken. If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it, right? Well, guess what? Our safety net is broken, and it\u2019s broken at such a fundamental level, there\u2019s no fixing it, because it is by design. A net full of holes must be replaced by a floor free of holes and that floor is unconditional basic income.\nNothing but net\u00a0holes\nIn the United States today, on average, just about one in four families living underneath the federal poverty line receives what most call welfare, which is actually known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. It gets worse. Because states are actually just written checks to give out as they please in the form of \u201cblock grants,\u201d there are states where far fewer than one in four impoverished families receive cash assistance.\nIn Oklahoma, seven out of 100 families living in poverty receives TANF. In Wyoming, merely one in 100 of those living in poverty receives TANF. Where does the money go instead? It goes to educate the children of those earning over six figures. It goes to programs trying to convince women to get married. And it goes directly to\u00a0state government treasuries so they can cut taxes on the rich. The fact is that cash welfare, as it exists today, is not given to the overwhelming majority of those living in poverty who need it.\nSingle adults without children know this better than anyone. They even have their own moniker: ABAWDs (Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents). ABAWDs have the lone distinction of being the only demographic in the U.S. to be literally taxed into poverty, all 7.5 million of them. Because they earn income and because they do not have the child necessary to qualify for virtually any assistance \u2014 even the earned income tax credit (EITC), which is meant as a boost for low-income\u00a0workers through the tax code \u2014 those earning enough to be above the federal poverty line can end up beneath the poverty line after paying taxes. And those already beneath the poverty line are pushed even deeper, effectively punished for being childless and working.\nCombine all of those without dependents with all of those with dependents but without sufficient\u00a0income to qualify for EITC and living in states averse to cash assistance, and the reality is that tens of millions of adults and children fall straight through the net purportedly designed to catch them. Any net is mostly nothing but holes, and nowhere is that more true than in the United States.\nAssumption: Everyone living beneath the poverty line receives cash assistance.\nObservation: Most don\u2019t.\nThe same is true of housing assistance. There is a belief that poor people galore are sitting on easy street with affordable living conditions, where housing vouchers are given away like Halloween candy to anyone with a hand out.\nThe truth is that 24 percent of those who qualify for housing assistance get it, and getting it can mean years of waiting on lists. Here in New Orleans, where I live, the wait list is opened about every seven years or so, and when it is, tens of thousands apply despite fewer than 1,000 people becoming new recipients of vouchers each year.\nAdditionally, vouchers are not at all \u201cjust like cash.\u201d Cash is accepted in payment by all landlords everywhere. Section 8 vouchers, meanwhile, are accepted only by those who choose to accept them, which is few and far between, and certainly not in what are considered to be \u201chigh opportunity\u201d neighborhoods. This is true even of \u201csupervouchers\u201d that are specifically designed for that purpose.\nAssumption: Everyone living in poverty receives housing assistance.\nObservation: Most don\u2019t.\nFood stamps, too, are not given to everyone living under the poverty line. About one-quarter of those living in poverty get no government food assistance, and of those who do, a third of them still need to visit food banks for added assistance because the amount given is nowhere close to being sufficient to get people through each month.\nEstimates point to food stamps lasting on average about three weeks of every month. Worse yet, food stamps can even have harsh time limits (e.g. three months of SNAP every three years), growing restrictions on how they can be used (sorry, no seafood allowed) and work requirements (30 hours per week).\nThis is food we\u2019re talking about. Why should any bureaucrat ever exist between the most basic\u00a0human need of all \u2014 the need to eat \u2014 and access to food?\nAssumption: Everyone living in poverty receives food assistance.\nObservation: Some may temporarily, but the amount is insufficient and full of costly strings.\nHowever, one of the best examples of all the vast differences between the assumption and the observation of how government benefits work is how we target those with disabilities. It has been estimated that 22 percent of adults in the U.S. have some form of disability. At the same time, 4.6 percent of adults age 18-64 in the U.S. are receiving disability income. So again, about one-quarter of those we say we should be targeting actually receive anything, while the bulk get nothing.\nIt\u2019s not just apples and oranges. It\u2019s rotten apples and ripe oranges.\nThe absolute worst thing though, and what too few people seem to know, is that when it comes to disability income, you are essentially not even allowed to earn additional income. If you\u2019re on SSDI and earn one dollar over $1,090 in a month, you are dropped from the program and lose 100 percent of your benefit. That is the steepest of \u201cbenefit cliffs\u201d and it\u2019s the equivalent of taxing those with disabilities at rates far greater than 100 percent as a reward for their labor. It\u2019s also the exact opposite of a basic income that is never taken away.\nIt is this clawback of means-tested benefits with the earning of income that is possibly the single greatest flaw of all targeted assistance, and also the single most ignored detail when people defend the current system over the introduction of a basic income that would replace it. Simply put, $1,000 per month in welfare is not at all the same thing as $1,000 per month in basic income. It\u2019s not just apples and oranges. It\u2019s rotten apples and ripe oranges.\nWith welfare, because it is targeted and therefore withdrawn as income is earned, people on welfare\u00a0are effectively punished for working. Their total incomes don\u2019t really increase with employment.\u00a0Welfare functions in many ways as a ceiling.\nWith basic income, because it is unconditional and therefore never withdrawn as income is earned, people with basic incomes are always rewarded for working. Their total incomes always increase with any amount of employment. Basic income therefore functions as a floor.\nDo you see the difference?\nSo when someone says the details matter when it comes to the idea of basic income and suggests the possibility that it could be regressive, and even increase inequality by taking money being targeted at the poor and giving it to the non-poor, understand that the details of the details matter even more than just the details.\nBasic income is not some regressive conspiracy of the Silicon Valley elite to create a neo-serfdom. \nThe regressive argument operates on the myth that for every four people living under the poverty line, four people get an amount of assistance that lifts them far above the poverty line, and that $1 of welfare is exactly equivalent to $1 in basic income.\nThe basic income argument operates on the reality that for every four people living under the poverty line, only about one person gets an amount of assistance that does more to trap them in poverty than to lift them out of it, and that $1 of welfare is worth far less than $1 of basic income.\nIt\u2019s really important to understand this, so let\u2019s zoom in a bit on a worst-case scenario. Let\u2019s assume we replace all of our programs targeted at the poor with UBI, including even Medicaid (which I don\u2019t recommend unless we replace it with universal healthcare instead), and that we provide the UBI to adults only, with nothing for kids (something else I don\u2019t recommend).\nUsing an example of a single parent with two kids within the current system, we could regressively replace around $45,000 of benefits (if we also eliminate child care, which is yet another detail I don\u2019t recommend) with $12,000 in cash. That is a worst-design scenario and totally regressive right? No. It\u2019s actually partially regressive and mostly progressive.\nAlthough true that one in four would be worse off in such an inferior UBI design, it\u2019s also true that three of four would be far better off because they would no longer receive little to nothing. As an oversimplified example for the sake of clarity, that means instead of the distribution across four adults being $45,000\/$0\/$0\/$0, it would be $12,000\/$12,000\/$12,000\/$12,000. That is more progressive as a whole than it is regressive, and inequality is reduced overall, not increased, because the total at the bottom went from $45,000 across four people to $48,000 across four people. And that is for basically the worst possible, most unrealistic of UBI designs.\nBut again, those numbers cannot be compared dollar for dollar. Welfare dollars disappear with work and basic income dollars are kept with work. That same parent receiving $45,000 for nothing, if they got a job paying $30,000 right now would receive $20,000 in benefits. That would be a gain of $30,000 combined with a loss of $25,000. That\u2019s a gain of $5,000 for a $30,000 job, or in other words, an income tax of 83 percent. Who else is taxed at 83 percent? No one. In fact, the richest are taxed the least because their income, which isn\u2019t derived from work, is special. It\u2019s simply capital gains, which is taxed at 20 percent.\nDoes this sound like a just and equitable system? Or does it sound more like a racist meat-grinder?\nEven more troubling, welfare dollars themselves are not equivalent to each other. Despite it being against the law to vary welfare dollars along racial lines, that\u2019s exactly what we do. How? It\u2019s again due to the nature of block grants for states. When Bill Clinton signed his welfare reform into law, he agreed to write checks to the states and let them handle how they dish out welfare. As a result, just five years after welfare was reformed into what it is today, 63 percent of those in the programs with the least-harsh conditions were white and 11 percent were black, while 63 percent of those in the programs with the most-harsh conditions were black and 29 percent were white.\nIn other words, a dollar in welfare has about three to five times as many strings for someone who is black than someone who is white. These strings absolutely affect end results. Joe Soss, co-author of Disciplining the Poor: Neoliberal Paternalism and the Persistent Power of Race\u00a0describes his findings thusly:\n\u201cThe stringency of the rules matter tremendously for outcomes. The tougher the rules \u2014 and the more frequently people are punished for breaking them \u2014 the worse the outcomes are for people after they finish the program. In fact, in the toughest programs, people actually end up in worse shape after they get through them than they were before they got the benefits to begin with. And remember, they were in such a bad situation that they had to turn to a welfare program that\u2019s been so stigmatized that pretty much everyone wants to avoid it. We also found that people who go through the toughest programs learn lessons about government that lead them to retreat from participating in politics. They become less likely to make their voices heard, and less likely to participate in elections and community organizations.\u201d\nDoes this sound like a just and equitable system? Or does it sound more like a racist meat-grinder?\nThe bare naked truth of our present welfare system is a racially biased, overly paternalistic, unnecessarily controlling, grossly exclusionary system of punishment and blame that limits opportunity and taxes working beneficiaries more than any other worker in any income tax bracket.\nIt doesn\u2019t abolish poverty. It helps sustain it. And this is the system establishment voices wish to improve upon in piecemeal fashion, possibly because they\u2019re not the ones being chewed up and spit out by it, or even neglected by it entirely.\nHowever, even if all of the above is clearly understood, there is one absolutely vital thing remaining to understand about basic income that cannot be replicated in any other way, by any other means. Because basic income lacks conditions and is paid regardless of work, it provides recipients the power to refuse to work. This is the real fear of those who worry a basic income will result in people working less, but it is also its greatest strength.\n\nThe ability to say no to an employer provides people the bargaining power and the choice to determine how they work, where they work, for how much and for how long. No other policy does that. A minimum wage certainly doesn\u2019t. Wage subsidies certainly don\u2019t. Without basic income, the labor market is coercive, and that means people accept what they can get. With basic income, wages for low-demand jobs must go up and\/or hours must go down in order to attract people with incomes independent of work to do them, or those same jobs must be automated to be performed by machines instead, whichever is cheaper.\nA basic income is most simply a minimum income floor. It\u2019s a new starting point above the poverty level instead of below it. There will still be jobs for people to earn additional income and those jobs can pay more if people hate doing them. Additionally, considering a potential future where there\u2019s half as much employment, that also means just as many can be employed if we all work half as much so as to better share the remaining employment. And with the increased bargaining power\u00a0basic income provides, that can also mean getting paid more for less work.\nBasic income is not some regressive conspiracy of the Silicon Valley elite to create a neo-serfdom where the entire population only earns a maximum of $12,000 per year. That is the exact opposite of how it works. With basic income, $12,000 becomes the new absolute minimum for everyone and no one is a serf because everyone\u2019s basic needs are covered. Poverty is eliminated. Inequality is reduced.\nAdditionally, everyone is free to earn any additional income, and on their terms. For the first time, everyone will have the individual negotiating power to dictate terms to employers that must be met. People who have this fundamental power are those who can then make further desired changes in the economy, in their businesses, in their governments and in their lives.\nSo you tell me. Would you prefer conditional welfare nets or would you prefer an unconditional basic\u00a0income floor? Because one of these options is a relic of history, and the other is a road to the future.","date":"2016-09-09T17:00:53","id":1380149,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/the-progressive-case-for-replacing-the-welfare-state-with-basic-income\/","slug":"the-progressive-case-for-replacing-the-welfare-state-with-basic-income","tags":[9379,449553172,419271376,449553171],"title.rendered":"The progressive case for replacing the welfare state with basic\u00a0income","views":487906},{"index":20,"author":103597267,"categories":[449549093,426985170,17396],"content.rendered":"This weekend, hundreds of developers and engineers\u00a0will pack into the Disrupt SF conference space for our Hackathon, a 24-hour race to build a brand-new product. Competitors will present their inventions on stage and win\u00a0prizes, in a TechCrunch tradition that\u2019s launched products like GroupMe.\nBut this year, we\u2019re doing things a little differently \u2014 we\u2019re making data from the\u00a0National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s Net Zero Energy Residential Test Facility available for developers to incorporate into their products. The Net Zero facility is a home in Maryland that NIST has transformed into a laboratory for conducting research on energy efficiency. The four-bedroom house produces all of its own energy, with some to spare, sending the excess back to the electrical grid. It\u2019s a model for the American home of the future, and it produces valuable data on energy use and production that developers can use to create new energy-efficient products.\nThe data comes to us from the Department of Commerce, which touts itself as America\u2019s data agency. DOC produces and publishes vast datasets, generating enough information every day to fill the Library of Commerce twice over. That includes the weather data and import\/export data that form the backbones of many a startup. Without that weather data, your favorite weather app couldn\u2019t function. And companies like Flexport, which we\u2019ve called \u201cthe unsexiest trillion dollar startup,\u201d use DOC\u2019s trade data to better serve their customers.\n\n\u201cWhen I became Secretary of Commerce, I made harnessing the power of Commerce data a top priority for the Department. To me, it was idle inventory on the shelf that I knew \u2014 from personal experience \u2014 has the power to create economic opportunity and change lives,\u201d\u00a0Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker told TechCrunch. \u201cThe hackathon is not only an opportunity to put our data to use in new and creative ways \u2014 it is also an opportunity to learn what we can be doing better.\u201d\nWe hope that our Disrupt SF hacking teams will take this opportunity to show these government folks how we do it here in Silicon Valley. They can use the Net Zero home\u2019s data sets to inform\u00a0other projects, or create projects that are completely focused on renewable energy. Teams can work to make homes smarter or create analytics tools to provide insights on energy efficiency.\u00a0We\u2019ll have data available from the house on 400 variables across 11 subsystems, including temperature, energy, lighting and electrical usage.\n\u201cWe would love to see developers create tools that visualize home energy use patterns. For instance, many Americans do not know that a clothes dryer consumes more energy than almost any other appliance in the home. With this information, individuals could make decisions that reduce the amount of energy they use and lower their energy costs,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cWe are also interested in the creation of an algorithm that predicts energy production from the home\u2019s solar panels. This type of information could be used as the basis for predicting energy production under various environmental conditions.\u201d\nThe market for these products is already enormous and is growing larger every day.\u00a0In December, the United States and every other member of the\u00a0United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In order to meet the commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement, it\u2019s estimated that the world will spend $13.5 trillion.\nThat\u2019s a big opportunity for major businesses, small startups, and bootstrapped products that are still only a glimmer in a hackathon participant\u2019s eye.\u00a0\u201cThis is an enormous opportunity for American businesses,\u201d Pritzker explained.\u00a0\u201cConsumers are increasingly demanding products that are sustainably produced and cost effective.\u201d\n\u201cBottom line, the transition to an advanced energy economy is not just a moral responsibility to our planet and future generations today, it is good business,\u201d she added.

While he will officially be given a CEO title in his new role, the position will be a rare point of continuity for a team that has changed hands twice in the last five years. We sat down with Young to get the scoop on what the transaction means for the future of McAfee and how the company will be challenged in the coming months to navigate a separation from Intel and find its stride in a rapidly changing cybersecurity ecosystem.\nThe history\nMcAfee was founded in 1987 by yoga aficionado\u00a0and reported real-life Narcos character John McAfee.\u00a0Some years later, in 2011, chip giant Intel purchased McAfee for $7.68 billion. The transaction was critical in that it tilted the company\u2019s focus toward the hardware layer.\nThis transaction was heavily criticized, but Intel remained bullish that McAfee would support\u00a0the company\u2019s growth into chip-level security solutions. DeepDefender, a tool for detecting and removing rootkits, became the key product of the acquisition. It\u00a0leveraged a priority load position to do its work, but ultimately was discontinued by the company in early 2015. McAfee, renamed the Intel Security Group by this point, continued to report growth, but never really met expectations from investors who patiently waited five years for a revolutionary new Intel security product that never came.\nShifting toward consumer IoT and full-service enterprise security\nWednesday\u2019s announcement marks a significant turning point in McAfee\u2019s history, away from chip-level innovation toward securing the Internet of Things for consumers and consolidating the number of cybersecurity companies enterprises have\u00a0to work with.\n\nWhile Intel will still own 49 percent of McAfee, Young says the company shouldn\u2019t be seen as half chip company. Young and his investors from TPG, which own 51 percent of the company, have a plan for the future that involves riding that trend of service consolidation by enterprise customers. It\u2019s common for large Fortune 500 companies to have security teams that work with dozens of cybersecurity providers for a slew of niche needs. Young explains that this creates accountability issues and communication problems when a company needs to respond to a hack.\nMcAfee wants to partner and buy its way to the top of the cybersecurity food chain to establish itself as a force within the industry that can connect the growing number of startups in the space via the central McAfee platform. The plan is incredibly ambitious for a company that is\u00a0on Day Two\u00a0of finding its identify separate from Intel. Young believes that capital from TPG will enable McAfee to acquire security companies more broadly that may not have fit in with the initial Intel vision.\nMcAfee still has offices co-located with Intel, but will be moving offsite in the future. Amidst all the change, employees have been anxious about what they are expected to do during the transition. Despite lofty goals, Young is instructing\u00a0employees to \u201cjust keep doing what they have been doing.\u201d\u00a0A transaction of such large\u00a0magnitude is more than enough to keep him\u00a0busy ironing out financial details and establishing the organizational structure, leadership and vision for the company.\nWhen the dust settles, and Young has forged a company identity, McAfee will focus on securing enterprise data centers. He\u00a0also wants the company\u00a0to continue working with device manufacturers and service providers to bolster the security\u00a0of things we use every day, like\u00a0cloud storage, communication and file sharing.\nFor consumers, focus will remain on offering a one-stop shop for simplifying security. McAfee\u2019s enterprise division is larger than its consumer division, but not by much. Users should be able to purchase\u00a0a single security solution that can evolve and remain device-agnostic. This is what sets McAfee apart from device manufacturers that secure their own devices, says Young. And while the Internet of Things has been mostly underwhelming to date, McAfee will be further developing partnerships to put an end to vulnerabilities on the accessories we use with our core devices.","date":"2016-09-09T16:37:38","id":1382966,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/incoming-mcafee-ceo-chris-young-on-his-companys-post-intel-future\/","slug":"incoming-mcafee-ceo-chris-young-on-his-companys-post-intel-future","tags":[449553238,8159,12068,449552885,64496],"title.rendered":"Incoming McAfee CEO Chris Young on his company\u2019s post-Intel\u00a0future","views":137506},{"index":22,"author":69381411,"categories":[449549093,426985170,17396],"content.rendered":"Hard to believe that Disrupt SF\u00a0is just around the corner!\u00a0Check out this guide for helpful event info.\nLogistics\nWe want you to have a successful experience at Disrupt.

This is generally an indication that the company will debut on the stock market in a matter of weeks.\nThe unicorn, whose largest shareholders include Battery Ventures and BlueRun Ventures, plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker, \u201cCOUP.\u201d The company plans to raise roughly $75 million, but this number is subject to change.\nCoupa competes with Oracle and SAP to provide \u201cspend management\u201d software, which means they help companies keep tabs on everyday expenditures. They claim they\u2019ve saved their customers $8 billion.\nFounded a decade ago, the San Mateo-company is still not profitable. For the six months ending in July of this year, Coupa lost $24.3 million, which is compared to $25.1 million in the same period last year. Revenue grew from $31.6 million to $53.2 million in the same timeframe.\n\nCoupa has been rumored to IPO for some time now. While it has been the least active year for tech IPOs since the financial crisis, the few that have gone through have done fairly well. Twilio has seen its shares nearly quadruple in the past three months. \nPart of the reason we saw so few tech IPOs this year was that many companies became afraid to go public after seeing industry peers struggle last year. Half the companies that listed saw their share prices decline.\nYet Coupa is amongst a small group of tech companies that are expected to IPO\u00a0this fall.

The first bots built by outside developers back in April were clumsy and more trouble than just using a website. So Facebook\u2019s Creative Shop is getting involved, working with bot maker Msg.ai and the Tommy Hilfiger fashion brand to make a flagship chatbot worthy to point to.\nThe TMY.GRL A.I. Messenger Bot will promote today\u2019s debut of Tommy\u2019s capsule fashion line for supermodel and social media star Gigi Hadid. People can discover it by tapping the message button on Tommy\u2019s Facebook page or posts, opening a shortlink URL or scanning its Messenger QR code.\n\nThrough the bot, fashionistas can type questions or select pre-made queries to learn about Gigi, see behind-the-scenes content from the collection\u2019s runway show event and, most importantly, shop for items from the nautical-themed clothing line.\nFacebook still hasn\u2019t built a native checkout and payment flow into its Messenger bot platform. Shoppers will be linked out to Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s website to put in their credit card details and confirm purchases. While that might give brands a deeper sense of control over the experience, it likely also reduces conversion rates as leaving Messenger gives them a chance to get distracted or reconsider buying something. It\u2019s something Facebook will hopefully build soon.\n\nI\u00a0asked why the company is diving into the unproven world of bots, Tommy Hilfiger himself told me \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on going directly to the consumer. We are obviously distributed in our own stores and in department stores, but going directly\u00a0to the consumer is really part of the motive and the future of the omni-channel process.\u201d\nPuneet Mehta, CEO of Msg.ai, explains that consumer goods companies are attracted to bots because of \u201cthe relationship aspect, not just sales.\u201d If they can create a memorable, interactive experience with their brand instead of just one-way marketing, customers will keep coming back. That\u2019s why Facebook\u2019s marketing experts from its Creative Shop, which typically help out advertisers, got their hands dirty on developing this bot.\nBotty Hilfiger\nHow did a 31-year-old company come up with the idea for a chatbot? Hilfiger tells me it started with \u201ca conversation I had with Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. We talked about innovative ways to enhance the shopping experience. We\u2019re always a bit ahead of the curve.\u201d\n\nChasing new technologies hasn\u2019t always panned out. While Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s Instagram and Snapchat strategies have been a success, 25 years ago it unsuccessfully tried to build touch-screen vending machines. Hilfiger explains that \u201cWe had lots of trials and tribulations with that. The credit card system was working, the touch-screen heated up.\u201d\nBut now he feels that by relying on a dependable company like Facebook, there\u2019s less to worry about and more to gain as customers\u00a0embrace new ways to shop.\nTommy Hilfiger CMO Avery Baker tells me that \u201cone of the things that\u2019s always been important in fashion is customer service and the experience in a store.\u201d The\u00a0TMY.GRL A.I. Messenger Bot will try to answer people\u2019s questions and offer a more immersive, responsive feel than shoppers usually get online.\nThe bot will try to capture some of the personality of talking to Gigi herself, while remaining transparent that there\u2019s not a human on the other end. \u201cNo one wants to feel like they\u2019re being spoken to by the corporate animal,\u201d Baker admits.\nFashion still seems like an unlikely candidate for chatbot success. People can\u2019t touch or try on the clothes, and the bot doesn\u2019t know enough about the user\u2019s style to make smart recommendations about which items they might prefer.\nBut Hilfiger believes this brand-specific bot could perform better than multi-brand retail shopping bots like Spring, which launched with the Messenger bot platform and was quickly proven confusing and unconvincing.\nTommy Hilfiger (center)\n\u201cI think if you\u2019re an established brand and the consumer is familiar with the brand, they have confidence that that certain cotton or cashmere or denim is the quality that would be acceptable, that they would be confident that the fit would be okay,\u201d Hilfiger concludes. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different reasons why people shop online. Now they can receive shipments, try on items, and send back what they don\u2019t accept. They don\u2019t necessarily need to touch and feel.\u201d\nAt the very least, Tommy Hilfiger could use the campaign to lure people into messaging their bot first. That\u2019s critical, since Facebook Messenger only lets brands message people who\u2019ve already pinged them. Getting conversations started is essentially the new version of getting people to Like your Facebook Page. Better to build an audience early than get left behind.","date":"2016-09-09T14:54:59","id":1382802,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/botty-hilfiger\/","slug":"botty-hilfiger","tags":[429083150,81819,6472307,3737,449553223],"title.rendered":"Facebook steps in to prove the value of chatbots with Tommy\u00a0Hilfiger","views":184730},{"index":25,"author":39990176,"categories":[24405894,21587494,17396],"content.rendered":"Dropbox has responded to concerns about how it implements the\u00a0desktop client of its cloud storage service on Apple\u2019s macOS platform,\u00a0conceding it needs to do more to communicate how\u00a0the\u00a0integration functions and the permissions it\u2019s requesting.\n\u201cClearly we need to do a better job communicating about Dropbox\u2019s OS integration.

The pressure to conquer space stemmed from the threat of progress by foreign nations, and, consequently, an ideology. But when government involvement in space increased in such countries as the United States in the 1980s, so too did the unexpected accidents and disasters.\nThe need for diversification as a means to mitigate technology-related risk ultimately served as an important catalyst to slowly open up the world of space to private enterprise. As an example, the Challenger accident in 1986 forced the Department of Defense to look for alternatives to the Space Shuttle. It was deemed too risky to have just one launch vehicle for missions.\nRelatively young companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin are ushering in the next era of space exploration as part of a new free market. Their progress to date has generated a significant amount of enthusiasm among the masses for a fresh set of safe and sustainable methods of transportation to the cosmos. And wherever there\u2019s enthusiasm, there\u2019s also interest from sources of private investment capital. As reported by CB Insights, VCs are paying more attention to technology startups that are accelerating the commercialization of space.\nIn 2015, VC investment in the sector increased by 253 percent year-over-year, and a whopping 2,052 percent since 2012. Although the capital deployed to date is concentrated on a few companies, such as SpaceX, OneWeb and O3b Networks, the influx still represents an appetite from select private investors to support the sector\u2019s progress.\nA surge in interest in outer space by sources of private capital presents the opportunity of rapid growth and commercialization that should, through the laws of supply and demand, drive down costs associated with cosmic ventures in the long run. This reality will make the space economy as accessible as any other on Earth several decades down the road. Private enterprises are also expected to take financial pressure off government institutions to engage in basic tasks like launching rockets, thus saving plenty of taxpayer dollars for other initiatives.\nContemporary space-based industries and businesses\nThe exploration and study of space has been embedded within a narrative that emphasizes and epitomizes human progress under the guise of our species\u2019 evolution. For many, this is reason enough to invest in the commercialization of space. But when stripping out this narrative, what exactly are the economic reasons for undertaking the huge financial and biological risks associated with exploring space? Do the risks currently outweigh the opportunities?\nTourism\nFor starters, with government bureaucracy having entirely controlled space for the past few decades, it only seems fitting for people to have a desire to fly up there and do what could have been done only by a select few astronauts a short while ago.\nSpace\u00a0tourism companies like Virgin Galactic and the eccentric entrepreneurs behind them (i.e. Richard Branson) have pushed space\u00a0tourism heavily in the media and on to front pages. But the whole notion of being able to \u201cexperience space\u201d is arguably being used as a precursor to the heavier and more profitable forms of private enterprise, each of which is scheduled to make an appearance in the coming decades.\nResource extraction and research\nAlthough space tourism represents the most prominent and active form of private enterprise interests taking shape in the cosmos today, other planned commercial ventures are also in the works for the foreseeable future.\u00a0The 2027 Mars One mission plans to open the door for corporations to bypass bureaucracy and fly people toward the Red Planet. Besides flybys and ceremonial long-distance trips, businesses are also looking toward asteroid mining, energy development and pharmaceuticals.\nThere are many opportunities prevalent in space, but for each opportunity there also exists a major challenge.\nIn the case of asteroid mining, there is huge potential to generate significant economic returns through extracting resources from a typical Near Earth Asteroid (NEA). It has been suggested by some scientists that one NEA may host trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of natural materials, making it a lucrative business for private investors and business professionals to pursue. Deep Space Industries\u2019 recently announced Prospector-1 mission will represent the world\u2019s first interplanetary mining mission.\nWith respect to energy development, space-based solar panel farms are being contemplated to power space technologies and locations, as well as equipment here on Earth. But given the high up-front investment costs required to complete such a project in comparison to output and revenues, the capability isn\u2019t expected for another several decades.\nAnd finally, in terms of pharmaceuticals, conducting medical research in micro-gravity space\u00a0conditions presents the potential for breakthroughs that will, as an example, see superior quality crystals replacing synthesized proteins for the use of manufacturing better drugs.\nMedia and entertainment\nIn addition to tourism, resource extraction and scientific research, space commercialization is taking shape through media, branding and advertising initiatives. Each of the current and planned uses of space by private enterprise present the opportunity for media syndication on mass levels that can generate significant revenue and global corporate ad impressions for various project-specific stakeholders.\nFor example, companies like Virgin Galactic and Space Adventures continue to use celebrity endorsements and paid-for, license-friendly media campaigns to generate interest in their services and get mass populations to see space as a frontier fit for conquering. Also, several opportunities exist for corporations like Mars One to syndicate and license content for small-scale missions and turn them into global phenomena, which will drive further interest in space exploration among the general population and the private enterprise sector. The organization has already garnered mass media attention for its astronaut selection process.\nThe net result of such branding activities is a significant step forward for the private enterprises engaging in commercial\u00a0space activity. These initiatives are poised to influence governments to further deregulate space for the sake of making the consumption of content easier and more affordable.\nChallenges and risks associated with the commercialization of space\nThere are many opportunities prevalent in space, but for each opportunity there also exists a major challenge. As noted by the United States House Science Subcommittee on Space, three things in particular make space exploration and development a not-so-attractive proposition: lack of financing for new ventures on a mass scale, lack of secured insurance and an inability to forge self-sustaining commercial markets.\nIndeed, many of these factors are changing, but they still present major roadblocks for entrepreneurs and private institutions.\nAccess to capital\nIn terms of lack of financing, private capital is still not flowing freely and blindly through to space-based enterprises like it is with internet-, digital media- and hardware-related technology businesses. In 2015,\u00a0approximately $129 billion in VC funding was deployed globally across 7,872 deals. Of this total, just over $2 billion was deployed to space-based companies across 44 deals. This makes sense, as the typical investment horizon for a VC is 7 to 10 years.\nSpace commercialization is here to stay despite the challenges and obvious roadblocks.\nSpace-based enterprises represent much longer investment horizons with a far greater risk of failure. And, naturally, without the necessary seed or growth-stage capital, it becomes very difficult for any entrepreneur to run a successful space-based private enterprise. As such, building a space-based business has largely been within the realm of successful tech billionaires.\nAccess to insurance\nThere also is a lack of adequate and secured insurance, which is because of the inability of insurers to see and test the reliability of\u00a0space-based technologies in the recent past. Few financial institutions are capable of providing space-based enterprises with the financial insurance that matches the scale of initiatives in space.\nInsurance is key for private businesses to offset the risk that was previously absorbed by governments, and to be able to engage in cosmic activities profitably with minimal risk, insurance capital needs to be available more freely.\nAbility to create self-sustaining markets\u00a0\nLastly, an inability to forge self-sustaining commercial markets in the past puts into question the commercial viability of space-based enterprises. Two decades ago, the commercial satellite business was expected to achieve independence within a few years of being established, but government involvement is still needed to this day to see projects to the execution phase. It can be argued that this was previously due to a lack of capital from private markets, as well as a lack of information available about space\u00a0commercialization within the public sphere. Luckily, these barriers are becoming less of an issue over time as the private sector absorbs the know-how that currently resides within the public sector.\nIn terms of risks overall, space entrepreneurs still need to prove they are up for the tasks related to commercializing space. Many fear that lives will be lost because proper precautions will not be taken. Given the laws in New Mexico regarding limited liability rights for corporations engaged in making space accessible for citizens, these concerns are not totally unfounded. After all, if something goes wrong in space, whose fault is it? And in the case of an international incident, which country\u2019s laws apply? These are important questions.\nThe verdict\nSpace commercialization is here to stay despite the challenges and obvious roadblocks. If history is any indication, the ostensibly innate human quest to conquer the \u201cfinal frontier\u201d will always prevail over rationality and intelligent foresight. This is a matter of the human condition, after all.\nAll of that having been said, continuous pressure should be placed on private institutions to ensure that the most prudent and wise decisions are made along the journey to commercialize space. Too much money and too many lives are potentially at stake to suggest otherwise.","date":"2016-09-09T14:00:33","id":1380146,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/opportunities-and-challenges-in-commercializing-space-privately\/","slug":"opportunities-and-challenges-in-commercializing-space-privately","tags":[728166,428386091,28467599,449553112,449553111,449553113,371748,1321469],"title.rendered":"Opportunities and challenges in commercializing space\u00a0privately","views":475639},{"index":28,"author":12084691,"categories":[424613844,1559,446313605,17396],"content.rendered":"Generating speech from a piece of text is a common and important task undertaken by computers, but it\u2019s pretty rare that the result could be mistaken for ordinary speech. A new technique from researchers at Alphabet\u2019s DeepMind takes a completely different approach, producing speech and even music that sounds eerily like the real thing.\nEarly systems used a large library of the parts of speech (phonemes and morphemes) and a large ruleset that described all the ways letters combined to produce those sounds. The pieces were joined, or concatenated, creating functional speech synthesis that can handle most words, albeit with unconvincing cadence and tone. Later systems parameterized the generation of sound, making a library of speech fragments unnecessary. More compact \u2014 but often less effective.\nWaveNet, as the system is called, takes things deeper. It simulates the sound of speech at as low a level as possible: one sample at a time. That means building the waveform from scratch \u2014 16,000 samples per second.\nEach dot is a separately calculated sample; the aggregate is the digital waveform.\nYou already know from the headline, but if you don\u2019t, you probably would have guessed what makes this possible: neural networks. In this case, the researchers fed a ton of ordinary recorded speech to a convolutional neural network, which created a complex set of rules that determined which tones follow other tones in every common context of speech.\nEach sample is determined not just by the sample before it, but the thousands of samples that came before it. They all feed into the neural network\u2019s algorithm; it knows that certain tones or samples will almost always follow each other, and certain others will almost never. People don\u2019t speak in square waves, for instance.\nIf WaveNet is trained with data from a single speaker, the resulting synthetic voice will resemble that speaker, since really, all the network knows about speech comes from their voice. But if you train it with multiple speakers, the idiosyncrasies of one person\u2019s voice may be cancelled out by someone else\u2019s, the result being clearer speech.\ndocument.createElement('audio');\nhttps:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/wavenet-1.wav\nClear enough that it outperforms existing systems handily, though it isn\u2019t without its quirks \u2014 perhaps a few more speakers need to be added to the stew.\nIt can\u2019t read text straight out just yet; written words need to be translated by another system not to audio but audio precursors \u2014 like computer-readable phonetic spelling. An interesting side effect of this is that if they train it without that text input, it produces an unnerving babble, as if the computer is speaking in tongues.\nhttps:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/wavenet_speaker-2.wav\nWhat\u2019s truly interesting, though, is the WaveNet\u2019s extensibility. If you train it with an American\u2019s speech, it produces American speech. If you train it with German, it produces German. And if you train it with Chopin, it produces\u2026 well, not quite Chopin, but piano in a logical, one might even be tempted to say creative vein.\nhttps:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/wavenet_sample_1.wav\nhttps:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/wavenet_sample_5.wav\nWhether it could produce a whole two-minute prelude is hard to say; composition isn\u2019t quite as easy to systematize as basic chords and chromatic agreement.\nWaveNet requires a great deal of computing power to simulate complex patterns at this extremely low level, so it won\u2019t be coming to your phone any time soon.

As of June, Amazon said there were\u00a0tens of thousands of developers working on Skills for Alexa, whose app store\u00a0had\u00a0grown to house over 1,400 of these add-ons.\nOf course, we all wish that Twitter was spending its time building a feature that would let us edit our tweets, instead of rolling out things like Read Receipts for messages (the horror!)\u00a0or new ways to hear our tweets read aloud, but I guess Alexa was a box\u00a0the company felt the need to check.\nYou can switch on the new Twitter Skill in the Alexa app on mobile or web, then authorize it\u00a0to access your Twitter account.\n\n\nNew on Amazon Alexa! Use the Twitter Reader skill to hear trends, top Tweets, notifications & more!

And, something even more telling of where the fashion industry is headed \u2014 they\u2019ll also be able to see how Minkoff\u2019s newest line looks on their own body using an app called Zeekit.\nMinkoff and her brother\/co-founder Uri Minkoff partnered with the startup to help real women connect with the brand. It works by uploading a photo of yourself and then picking out clothing items from the show. Zeekit will then overlay those items on your body using the size you choose.\nSo instead of\u00a0mentally noting how a certain item would look on you instead of that lanky model, you can see it in augmented reality and in your size.\nThe brother-sister duo has used tech to connect with its audience at past shows, like drones and VR, and the latest experience is an outgrowth of what\u2019s worked to bring in consumers. But\u00a0Uri, who recently caught up with me via phone, also says it\u2019s a way to keep up with\u00a0women in a new tech-savvy era of fashion to improve his brand\u2019s bottom line \u2014 particularly with reduction of returns.\n\u201cThe industry standard for returns is 20 percent to 40 percent,\u201d he told me. Zeekit\u00a0could help reduce headaches by more accurately predicting which size dress or slacks look best on your body.\nBut Rebecca Minkoff\u2019s show isn\u2019t the only one integrating tech. Thanks to fashion bloggers and the rise of social media, items once kept close for months at a time by designers and fashion editors are readily available to see \u2014 and buy.\nMore brands like Minkoff and Hilfiger are now selling items\u00a0seen on the runway that day, and other lines like\u00a0Noon by Noor, Band of Outsiders, Prabal Gurung and others have also hopped on the VR bandwagon to introduce the latest to armchair fashion fans, as well.\nBut Uri says tech has also changed the habits of a younger generation of buyers. It\u2019s an Instagram era, and young women are staging their own fashion shows now. We\u2019re seeing more diversity in the industry and real women on magazines. They\u2019re not buying if they think the fashion is made for lanky models and not them.\nIntegration of VR and augmented reality apps like Zeekit\u00a0enable real women to see themselves in the clothing, not just runway models, and Uri believes the app could help boost buyer confidence in his brand. It\u2019s a way to make his line accessible to every woman, not just a five-foot-ten-inch, bone-thin model.\n\u201cI think that will then take away some of the elite nature and exclusivity that has been part of fashion and bring it to a more real place that will further spark interest in relatability,\u201d Uri said.","date":"2016-09-09T12:44:14","id":1382855,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/rebecca-minkoffs-fashion-week-show-uses-augmented-reality-to-help-real-women-shop-the-look-live\/","slug":"rebecca-minkoffs-fashion-week-show-uses-augmented-reality-to-help-real-women-shop-the-look-live","tags":[282669,102242,7772614,907132],"title.rendered":"Rebecca Minkoff\u2019s Fashion Week show uses augmented reality to help real women shop the look\u00a0live","views":316882},{"index":32,"author":15157806,"categories":[2024,37621928,15986864,1102388,20429,17396,2401],"content.rendered":"At a press conference in San Francisco today, Ford Motor Co.\u00a0president and CEO Mark Fields announced that the company had both acquired a rideshare startup called Chariot\u00a0and made a significant investment in expanding the region\u2019s bike-share program.\nFord\u2019s sponsorship will see the Bay Area\u2019s supply of shareable bikes expand from 700 to 7,000 by 2018, with 1,350 bikes going to the East Bay, and hundreds of new bike-share stations established to distribute the bikes.\nThe locations of the bike stations are still being determined, but these will be in and around Berkeley, Oakland and San Jose, not just in San Francisco.\nThe bike-share program is managed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the Bay Area, and operated by a startup called Motivate, which also operates popular bike-share programs around the country, with their largest market in New York.\nMotivate\u00a0president and CEO Jay Walder said his company saw 10 million bike-share trips taken in New York in 2015, and that bike share would become part of the fabric of cities, increasingly. He did not offer projections for San Francisco bike-share usage.\nIn terms of technology, the bikes, now branded as the Ford GoBike, are not much to behold. They\u2019re manufactured by Motivate and assembled domestically by Detroit Bikes.\nThey don\u2019t include racks for cargo, a helmet or systems that would allow them to be parked or picked up anywhere. They\u2019re more the sturdy, traditional bike-share bike with an electronic tracking and locking system.\nIn addition to ramping up the local, shareable bike supply, Ford will begin to show bike stations and available bikes within its Ford Pass app, said Fields.\nFord\u2019s Pass app aims to be a single place where users can find available transportation or mobility options nearby whenever they need them.\nPoliticians and advocates \u2014 including San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates and San Jose Mayor and MTC Commissioner Sam Liccardo \u2014 showed up to ballyhoo the bike-share expansion and promote the idea that mobility options and transportation should be provided by not just public agencies but large, private sector partners.","date":"2016-09-09T12:36:49","id":1382846,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/ford-backs-massive-bike-share-expansion-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area\/","slug":"ford-backs-massive-bike-share-expansion-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area","tags":[5270098,449553216,1114561,449553214,449553215,449553218,449553219,449553217,449553220,2562683],"title.rendered":"Ford backs massive bike-share expansion in the San Francisco Bay\u00a0Area","views":278062},{"index":33,"author":89646803,"categories":[17396],"content.rendered":"The Honest Company, the consumer\u00a0products startup that has largely operated in the limelight thanks to its famous cofounder, actress Jessica Alba, is talking with larger, more traditional consumer\u00a0packaged goods outfits\u00a0that are interested in purchasing the company, confirms a source close to the company.\nRecode wrote yesterday that the company was engaged in acquisition discussions that may or may not result in a sale.\u00a0Honest Company, founded five years ago in L.A., was reportedly\u00a0valued at $1.7 billion when it raised $100 million in financing last year. Altogether, it has raised\u00a0$222 million\u00a0from investors\u00a0and, according to Recode, it generated revenue of $300 million last year. (A\u00a0three-month-old\u00a0Bloomberg report said its sales last year were $275 million.)\nA source tells us that the vast majority of the Honest Company\u2019s\u00a0revenue is\u00a0being\u00a0generated via the company\u2019s sites, but that\u00a0it\u2019s currently seeing its fastest growth\u00a0by selling wholesale through more than 6,000 stores, including Target, Whole Foods, Costco and, until\u00a0recently, through its own L.A.-based pop-up store at the city\u2019s shopping center,\u00a0The Grove.\nThat store closed on July 28. It should be noted that pop-up stores have a limited run by design.\nIn June, Bloomberg reported that\u00a0Honest was prepping \u201cslowly\u201d for an IPO, following a report in Bloomberg in February that said Honest was working with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on a public offering.\nHonest makes both home products and cosmetics, including a new hair care line. Its next area of focus will apparently be on a line-up of nail-related items.\nWe sat down with Alba and Honest\u2019s chief marketing officer Chris Thorne at\u00a0our New York Disrupt conference in May, where we discussed the company\u2019s growth, along with several lawsuits that have been filed against it, including a\u00a0class action lawsuit that was filed last year, claiming its sunscreen\u00a0product didn\u2019t work, and a newer suit that alleges its organic baby formula includes 11 \u201csynthetic substances that are not allowed in organic products.\u201d\nThorne said then that Honest Company takes customer service issues seriously. He also said that while the company supports consumer advocacy groups, Honest \u201coften gets involved in the discussion because we bring a name, Jessica\u2019s name, and that brings a lot of attention to an issue, and it\u2019s a smart strategy for  but unfortunate for us, because we do get brought into these.\u201d\nAs for those reported discussions with bankers, Thorne said that Honest \u201cconstantly talks to advisors and banks to stay up to date on trends and competitors,\u201d adding, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary there.\u201d\nE-commerce first companies have been a hot commodity of late, as traditional retailers look for ways to remain relevant to younger consumers. Early last month, Walmart announced plans to acquire the online retailer Jet for $3.3 billion in cash and stock. In July, the online grooming startup Dollar Shave Club was sold to the consumer giant Unilever for $1 billion.\nNewer businesses\u00a0that cater largely to female shoppers have also become attractive acquisition candidates.\u00a0In July, for example, IT Cosmetics, an eight-year-old, Jersey City, N.J.-based company that makes 300 skin-care and make-up products, was sold to L\u2019Oreal for $1.2 billion in cash.","date":"2016-09-09T11:55:00","id":1382820,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/confirmed-honest-company-in-talks-to-sell\/","slug":"confirmed-honest-company-in-talks-to-sell","tags":[33663,977,6877,71123637],"title.rendered":"Confirmed: Honest Company in talks to\u00a0sell","views":12181},{"index":34,"author":1603003,"categories":[4213,329026,13217,3457,17396],"content.rendered":"Facebook has backtracked on its decision to censor a Norwegian journalist and newspaper\u2019s posts, reinstating the nude photo of a child fleeing napalm during the Vietnam war. Facebook had originally told The Guardian that \u201cWe try to find the right balance between enabling people to express themselves while maintaining a safe and respectful experience for our global community.\u201d\nNow Facebook\u2019s statement to TechCrunch (emphasis ours) is that:\n\u201cAfter hearing from our community, we looked again at how our Community Standards were applied in this case. An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time. Because of its status as an iconic image of historical importance, the value of permitting sharing outweighs the value of protecting the community by removal, so we have decided to reinstate the image on Facebook where we are aware it has been removed. We will also adjust our review mechanisms to permit sharing of the image going forward.\u00a0It will take some time to adjust these systems but the photo should be available for sharing in the coming days. We are always looking to improve our policies to make sure they both promote free expression and keep our community safe, and we will be engaging with publishers and other members of our global community on these important questions going forward.\u201d\nFacebook continues to find itself in problematic situations as it attempts to control what appears in the News Feed. Earlier this year it cited a \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d for why a Live video of Philando Castile dying after being shot by police disappeared from the social network for several hours before reappearing.\nAt the time, Mark Zuckerberg said\u00a0\u201cThe images we\u2019ve seen this week are graphic and heartbreaking, and they shine a light on the fear that millions of members of our community live with every day.\u201d That indicated that Facebook saw value in transmitting graphic and potentially disturbing content if it had news value. The company later clarified its policy to me, explaining that it only removes graphic content if it\u00a0celebrates or glorifies violence.\n\nI\u2019ve recommended that Facebook allow people to report content as graphic but newsworthy so the social network can obscure potentially offensive imagery with a warning that people can click through if they still want to view it. Right now, users can only report content as offensive or graphic, but without the caveat that they think it should stay up. Facebook says people should simply report offensive imagery and it will make the call about what to do with it.\nPutting a disclaimer interstitial covering the image\u00a0would have been a better option in the case of the napalm girl photo, at least until it could decide whether to simply leave it fully visible, instead of deleting the posts containing it.\nThese censorship blunders combined with the decreasing visibility of news outlets in the feed are surely pushing publishers to reconsider their reliance on Facebook. Unfortunately, most pull too much traffic from Facebook to simply ditch it. Meanwhile, many have already began working with its Instant Articles program that decreases load time in exchange for giving Facebook sweeping control over the visual form of articles and limits the monetization, subscription, and recirculation options publishers typically use on their own sites.\nIn hindsight, publishers should have been working to deepen direct relationships with their readers rather than jumping head first into a channel they don\u2019t control.","date":"2016-09-09T11:08:32","id":1382817,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/facensorbook\/","slug":"facensorbook","tags":[81819],"title.rendered":"Facebook restores censored nude \u2018napalm girl\u2019 photo due to \u201chistorical importance\u201d","views":122249},{"index":35,"author":31035538,"categories":[20429,17396],"content.rendered":"Seattle-based Rover is in the process of closing a $40 million round of funding, according to sources with knowledge of the deal.\nThe Series E round would value Rover at nearly $300 million, and it comes from existing investors Menlo Ventures, Madrona Venture Group and Foundry Group.

Now users can pay a 1% fee for an instant (same-day) withdraw, or wait until the next day for a free transfer.

This is a condensed version of several Wirecutter guides; you can find links to the full guides in the discussions below.\nWe go to conferences to meet people, learn things, and maybe set up some deals. But often we end up meeting sore muscles in our shoulders that we didn\u2019t know existed, learning what dehydration feels like, and making compromises with our inboxes about when we might get back to all those emails \u2014 if ever.\nWe at The Wirecutter know how conferences go, since we\u2019ve been to a lot of them. We\u2019ve drawn on our own experiences hustling from room 104A to 305B, lugging an entire day\u2019s worth of stuff on our shoulders to pick out this collection of best-in-class gear and supplies to help you (and ourselves) survive long battles with weak signals, minimal outlets, and other people in similar situations.\nUltralight laptop\nThe Dell XPS 13 (non-touch) is the best Windows ultrabook for most tech-conference attendees. Photo: Kimber Streams\nAsk anyone who has been to CES 10 or 20 times\u2014when it comes to the light-enough laptop you\u2019re lugging around for hours on end while trying to cover Press Day, a pound or two makes a big difference. For the best battery life and performance inside a light and well-made Windows ultrabook, we like the Dell XPS 13. If that\u2019s a bit too much cash, the Asus ZenBook UX305UA provides most of the same benefits. \nNormally we\u2019d first recommend the 13-inch MacBook Air to anyone and everyone needing a laptop, but the timing is terrible right now, as the whole MacBook line is overdue for updates. If you specifically need OS X (soon to be macOS) for work, try to wait until that update happens; it\u2019s expected in the next month or so. If you need a new Mac right now, check out our \u201cWhich MacBook Should I Buy\u201d guide. \nWi-Fi hotspot\nCarry your own Wi-Fi around with the Verizon Jetpack. Photo: Rob Pegoraro\nConference Wi-Fi is slowly getting a little better, thanks to newer technologies. And most carriers offer some kind of tethering option, so your phone can lend its Internet connection to your laptop in a pinch. But if you know you\u2019ll need regular, solid, somewhat speedy Web access in a crowded space, you\u2019ll want the Verizon Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot AC791L. \nVerizon\u2019s LTE service is the best, but the hotspot itself is pretty handy, too, with 20 hours of battery life and the ability to charge your phone in a pinch. AT&T customers should check out the Netgear AT&T Unite Pro.\nPortable AC power supply\nIf you need to power your laptop on the go, having a battery with an AC-power outlet like the ChargeTech can reduce outlet anxiety. Photo: Michael Hession\nIt\u2019s just a fact of conference life: There are never enough plugs. Free yourself from the desperate search entirely with a ChargeTech Portable Power Outlet. It\u2019s essentially a big ol\u2019 portable battery with a wall plug, but it\u2019s the best one so far in balancing size, capacity, and price.\nPortable surge protector and USB wall charger\nGet all of your stuff charged in one sitting\u2014or share and make new friends\u2014with our favorite USB wall charger, which offers four ports in a compact package.

But you can make a few people smile if you turn one lonely AC port into four, or even six, fast-charging USB ports with a multiport charger like the Anker 40W PowerPort 4. And you can get three AC ports, no matter how cramped the socket, with our favorite travel surge protector, the Accell Home or Away. Even if you don\u2019t get to be the hero, at least your hotel room will be well-outfitted.\nUSB battery pack\nThe Bolt is a bit smaller and a bit thicker than most smartphones\u2014a good size to carry around all day. Photo: Michael Hession \nLots of factors conspire to kill your smartphone battery level at a conference. Bad cell reception inside a huge concrete bunker is one big factor. Boring talks and panels that leave you endlessly scrolling are another. Using GPS navigation to get to that restaurant you heard about? Yep, that too. Bring one of the four sizes of USB battery pack we recommend, such as the soap-bar-sized Jackery Bolt, and you can top off your phone more quickly and reliably than the folks who bought their packs at the airport.\niPhone 5 and 6 cases\nIncipio\u2019s NGP for iPhone 6 and 6s fully protects without being bulky, letting you stuff your pockets with business cards and thumb drives instead. Photo: Nick Guy\nWhatever version of the iPhone has a special place in your hand, you don\u2019t want it to be any bulkier than it needs to be. You also don\u2019t want it to break while you\u2019re away from home. Most cases are just okay, but a few are great. \nWe found that Incipio\u2019s NGP case (for 6\/6s or 6 Plus\/6s Plus, and for 5, 5s, and iPhone SE) hits that midpoint of bulk and all-sides protection best. Of course, if you\u2019re reading this article here, you probably know the iPhone 7 was just announced and thanks to its new camera cutout, iPhone 6\/6s cases won\u2019t fit. But if you\u2019re not in a rush to upgrade, for less than $20, you can still ensure that your tried-and-true iPhone remains crack-free until it\u2019s trade-in time.\nMicro-USB and Lightning cables\nA sturdy build is part of what makes Anker\u2019s PowerLine cable particularly appealing, especially in a rough-and-tumble environment. Photo: Michael Hession\nWhat sets apart a good Micro-USB or Lightning cable from the hundreds of others you can buy anywhere? Durability, for one thing. Anker\u2019s PowerLine cables, both Android-friendly Micro-USB and Apple-oriented Lightning, are reinforced with Kevlar fiber and PVC strain-relief collars, and they feel stronger and better than any other cable we\u2019ve tested. The company offers an 18-month warranty and has a solid reputation for hardware design and customer service.\nBluetooth tracker\nThe Tile can help you find a lost item within 150 meters, and it\u2019ll do so even more easily with dozens of connected Tile owners around. Photo: Nick Guy\nA Bluetooth-based tracker is pretty handy\u2014wave your phone somewhere within 150 meters of your keys or bag or whatever you can\u2019t stand to lose, and it\u2019ll make a noise you can track. In the confusion of a conference, our favorite tracker, the Tile, becomes nearly essential. \nWith its Community Find feature, if you should, say, suddenly realize you\u2019re without your backpack, you can mark it as lost, and Tile will quietly use the Bluetooth signals of everybody else who has a Tile (and in the world of tech conferences, that\u2019s sure to be more than a few) to find your item. You can send that person an anonymous thanks, and the interconnected world will feel a little nicer.\nWater bottle and travel mug\nOur favorite water bottle, the 27-ounce Klean Kanteen Classic with Loop Cap, will keep you hydrated throughout the day. Photo: Seamus Bellamy\nWe\u2019ve spent more than 70 hours researching and testing water bottles made of all kinds of materials over three years, testing 54 models for leaks, weird smells, dishwasher safety, and other features. To save money on rip-off conference water, and to keep yourself hydrated during your coffee-fueled, sleep-deprived days spent breathing recycled hotel and conference center air, grab a Klean Kanteen Classic. \nIf, on the other hand, your need to keep your good coffee and tea warm so you can avoid kiosk sludge, grab our favorite travel mug, the Zojirushi New Stainless Steel Mug. Both items deserve a place in your bag.\nLaptop backpack and briefcase\n\nThe InCase Icon on our tester\u2019s back. It\u2019ll carry all of your conference needs in style and comfort. Photo: Tim Barribeau\nUnless you need to project an aura of being a Professional in a Serious Field demanding Trust and Stature\u2122, a backpack is much, much better than a briefcase for distributing your gear\u2019s weight and preventing shoulder or arm pain. \nOur favorite business-casual laptop backpack, the Incase Icon Pack, can fit a ridiculous amount\u2015big loose stuff, a home office\u2019s worth of little gadgets in pockets, quick-access things in the front, and more. If you do need the spiff and style of a briefcase, we think the Timbuk2 Hudson Laptop Briefcase 2015 is the best computer-friendly briefcase for most people.\nNotebook, pen, and pencil\nYou can\u2019t beat the portability and practicality of a pocket notebook, and writing down new information should help you remember it better. Photo: Nina Johnson\nThe motto for notebook maker Field Notes is \u201cI\u2019m not writing it down to remember it later, I\u2019m writing it down to remember it now.\u201d Writing things down locks in ideas and makes you consider them more. For a few notes and quotes taken here and there, we recommend Field Notes three-packs in our travel guide. \nIf you\u2019re a serious note-taker, consider a spiral-bound or hardcover notebook from Black n\u2019 Red. All of those notebooks have paper with minimal to no bleed-through, and their bindings are tough enough to survive a ride in your backpack or briefcase. As for what to write with, although you can find plenty of free pens at conferences, you\u2019ll feel better writing with a quality pen or a mechanical pencil. \nWe like the smooth, quick-drying, non-bleeding Uni-ball Jetstream pen, or the self-sharpening, remarkably consistent Uni-ball Kuru Toga pencil.\nHand sanitizer\nKeep a bottle of easy-to-find Purell hand sanitizer with you for those long days of pressing the flesh.\nShaking hands and trading business cards? Yeah, that\u2019s a germ experience. But don\u2019t forget the other micro-bio-nightmares. You have escalator and stair railings, taxicabs and hotel shuttles, bins full of snacks (if you\u2019re lucky), the handles on coffee creamer carafes, cramped meeting rooms in which people sneeze, and your phone screen, which you keep touching all day lo\nng. Fill one of your bag pockets with a bottle of Purell.\nIt performs about equally to our actual favorite hand sanitizer (Method Sweet Water), but it\u2019s much easier to find. Alcohol-free sanitizers are around, too, but the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend them, and their ingredients can sometimes cause reactions.\nThe links in these guides contain affiliate codes.

Ford sees the startup as the path forward for its fledgling mobility company, which was officially incorporated in March, and so far has generally stuck to more\u00a0limited-scope tests of its offering, mostly in partnership with academic institutions.\nChariot was founded in 2014, and has actually used Ford vehicles since day one. That\u2019s just a coincidence, the company tells me, but it still uses only 15-seater Ford Transit vans with a tell-tale Chariot paint job. For Chariot, what being part of\u00a0Ford Smart Mobility is the ability to ramp up quickly and increase the pace of expansion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be super aggressive in expanding to multiple markets over the next year,\u201d said\u00a0Chariot CEO and co-founder Ali Vahabzadeh in an interview with TechCrunch.\u00a0\u201cIt became very clear very early on that Chariot would be able to leverage Ford\u2019s expertise in logistics and vehicle and operations to take Chariot and make this a global service, beyond just the Bay area.\u201d\nExisting Chariot service will continue uninterrupted, according to the company, and even the look will remain the same. Chariot will also grow out to at least five more markets in the next 18 months, according to Ford and Chariot, and the next market will be revealed sometime in the next few weeks. Vahabzadeh told me that Ford can help with expansion not only in terms of funds and logistics expertise, but also through its relationships with governments in countries and cities around the world.\nChariot\u2019s goal was to provide a transit situation that sits near public transit in terms of cost, but that provides faster and more convenient routes. The platform crowdsources the creation of routes, aggregating desired pick-up and destination data from user interaction with its app and determining routes once interest in a particular one reaches a tipping point. It currently has 28 routes in the Bay area, with 100 vans in operation.\n\u201cWe had this vision of creating this perfect commute, which was fast, reliable affordable and safe for the people of San francisco and eventually beyond,\u201d explained Vahabzadeh.\nFord isn\u2019t the only company to invest in shared transportation solutions; GM has its own internally-founded startup Maven, as well as a partnership with Lyft, for instance. And the Chariot model actually would fit in very nicely with Ford\u2019s self-driving car plans, which include aiming to put a network of multi-passenger vehicles on the road to provide on-demand transit alternatives.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long road ahead, but it\u2019s just another reason why hooking up with Ford Smart Mobility now make sense,\u201d said Vahabzadeh, noting that the companies will indeed look at how automation might fit into Chariot\u2019s future.\nChariot and Ford declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal.","date":"2016-09-09T09:56:24","id":1382763,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/ford-mobility-solutions-acquires-chariot\/","slug":"ford-mobility-solutions-acquires-chariot","tags":[1114561,19071,449553198,1093],"title.rendered":"Ford Smart Mobility acquires Chariot to boost its smart city transit\u00a0plans","views":129236},{"index":39,"author":2414667,"categories":[4213,120,17396],"content.rendered":"Facebook Moments, the company\u2019s private photo-sharing application which took the place of mobile photo sync late last year,\u00a0is now expanding beyond the confines of your mobile phone and your personal network. While previously, the app allowed you to share your photos with select Facebook friends, the new version allows you to share a web link\u00a0to your private album with anyone \u2013 even those you\u2019re not connected with on the social network. They can then join the album, and proceed to add their own photos.\nThis makes Moments more useful at\u00a0larger events where not everyone may\u00a0be\u00a0connected on Facebook, such as baby showers, weddings, parties, and more.\nTo access the new feature, you can either pull up one of your existing moments (aka albums) or create a new one, then click on the three dots at the bottom-right of the screen. Here, you\u2019ll see the new options to \u201cShare Link\u201d which gives you a URL you can send over email, messaging, or through any other means you prefer.\n\nThis web support follows a move by Google Photos earlier this spring which added improvements to shared albums \u2013 notably, the ability for users to add their own photos to a shared album they received from a friend, as well as support for commenting. Facebook Moments, meanwhile, was still limited to private photo-sharing among Facebook friends at the time.\nThe upgraded Moments application is rolling out another new feature, as well: support for full-resolution photos. While the app already will host all your photos for free, it wasn\u2019t a true photo backup service as it would optimize those photos for mobile use.\n\nThat changes a bit with the addition of a new \u201cFavorites\u201d tab in Moments. When you add a photo to your Favorites by clicking the star at the top-right corner within 30 days of uploading them or receiving them, it will then be saved in Moments in full resolution. There\u2019s no limit on the number of photos you can favorite either, notes Facebook.\nThis again, seems a direct response to Google Photos, which launched with free, unlimited photo storage plus\u00a0the option to choose a different plan where you can save full-res photos to your Google Storage. The difference is that Google Photos requires you to pay\u00a0for the additional storage you need beyond the 15 GB it offers for free, which is also shared across Google Drive and Gmail.\nFacebook, instead, is requiring you pick-and-choose which photos deserve to be saved in full-res \u2013 likely knowing that the manual labor involved with starring each photo will cut down on people\u00a0uploading entire albums at the\u00a0original resolution. Of course, Moments is still not an alternative to a full photo backup service, but it could be a cheaper option than Google Photos if you\u2019re one of those people who is already close to maxing out your free storage, due to heavy Gmail or Google Drive use.\nThe updated app is live on the iTunes App Store and Google Play.","date":"2016-09-09T09:33:43","id":1382768,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/facebook-photo-sharing-app-moments-expands-to-web-adds-support-for-full-res-photos\/","slug":"facebook-photo-sharing-app-moments-expands-to-web-adds-support-for-full-res-photos","tags":[10925739,4213,81819,17768733,40651934,120,304],"title.rendered":"Facebook photo-sharing app Moments expands to web, adds support for full-res\u00a0photos","views":215072},{"index":40,"author":521068,"categories":[24405894,15328,17396],"content.rendered":"Online tools like Office 365 have changed the way we work and collaborate with our colleagues, but often projects involve people outside of your organization, whether partners, consultants or vendors. Microsoft acknowledged that reality today when it announced the ability to invite guests to view or edit Office 365 content.\nIt\u2019s not going to all happen at once, but over time Office 365 users will be able to include outside parties in their project.

To be clear, this coordination only works because everyone agrees to it voluntarily\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and if the U.S. insists on inserting itself, those using the function could agree to do things another way.\nIn fact, in a reversal from the stereotype of a bureaucracy seeking ever-expanding power, the government agency that would be tasked with this role agrees that the plan to implement the functions without the U.S. government would work just fine. Unfortunately, those advancing arguments for U.S. involvement demonstrate fundamental misunderstandings about how the internet works. Indeed, continued U.S. government involvement in this function makes it more likely, not less, that the outcomes critics seek to avoid\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including interference by foreign government in the operation of the internet \u2014\u00a0would come to pass.\nSince 1998, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has performed a critical but basically clerical job for the internet: the IANA functions. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (or IANA) is a little like a land registry for the internet: It performs a critical function because keeping the registry up to date and available is important, but it is also basically a clerical job because all the policy decisions are made by someone else.\nHistorically, ICANN has performed the IANA functions under a contract with the U.S. Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). It was always the intention, from the founding of ICANN, for that contract to fade away as the internet community developed oversight mechanisms that could replace NTIA\u2019s role.\nThe people on the internet who set the policies for the various IANA registries have come up with those oversight mechanisms. Accordingly, NTIA has announced that it intends to let the current contract with ICANN expire at the end of September. If that happens, then starting in October, the stewardship of the IANA functions will be performed just like everything else on the internet: through collaboration of the interested parties (most of whom are from the private sector).\nThis is a clear example of a government program that worked. The conditions for success were laid out, and they were met \u2014 and now the government can step out of the way and allow the private sector to keep up the pace of innovation on the internet.\nIt is particularly dangerous to suggest that maintaining the U.S.\u00a0government\u2019s role in IANA will prevent attempts by foreign governments to interfere with the internet. On the contrary, the best way to encourage interference is for the U.S. to refuse to complete a transition that was first discussed when the founder of Facebook was 14 years old.\u00a0Over the past two years, people from all over the internet have been working on nailing down the details of this stewardship transition.\nThe system works and is stable today because the various actors can be relied upon to do what they say.\nIf the U.S.\u00a0government pulls the rug out from under all that work at the last minute, it will encourage foreign governments\u2019 claims that the U.S. really does have control. It will inspire them to renew calls to move IANA stewardship to the United Nations or some other intergovernmental forum. Instead of enacting the current plan, which will be invisible to practically every person on the internet, reasserting U.S.\u00a0government authority will make the internet an international political football.\nAnd the truth is that the U.S.\u00a0government does not have control anyway. The internet is a voluntary system: In a network of networks, there is no center of control because there is no center. The only thing that works is positive incentives to do the right thing in your enlightened self-interest. People use IANA today because it is convenient to do so. Make it inconvenient, and you set up the conditions by which people turn to some other mechanism.\nSo, any reassertion of U.S.\u00a0government power depends on a fantasy that the U.S. government actually can assert that power. If the U.S. government does not keep faith with its previous announcements about the IANA transition, the users of IANA are just as likely to give up on it and go find another way to solve their problems. \nThe system works and is stable today because the various actors can be relied upon to do what they say. If one party (such as the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0government) changes its mind with no technical justification, everyone else will need to think twice about what that party will do in other cases. Such mistrust would introduce much bigger changes than merely letting the IANA contract expire, as it is set to do.\nWe have a good plan for stewardship of the IANA functions. Once in place, it will work just like everything else on the internet: through bottom-up, private-sector-led, voluntary cooperation. It is the U.S.\u00a0government role that is the anomaly. The people who actually make the internet work \u2014 the technical organizations that make the infrastructure and civil society groups dedicated to freedom of expression on the internet\u00a0\u2014 believe their stewardship plan is the true way to protect and foster the internet. It is time to get the U.S.\u00a0government out of the way, and let the internet work the way it is designed to, resistant to control by any one government or organization.","date":"2016-09-09T08:00:30","id":1380175,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/the-us-is-not-handing-over-the-internet\/","slug":"the-us-is-not-handing-over-the-internet","tags":[449553201,874475,166608,22,449553200,449553199,449548311],"title.rendered":"The U.S. is not \u2018handing over\u2019 the\u00a0internet","views":255854},{"index":43,"author":2414667,"categories":[4213,120,17396],"content.rendered":"The Google Photos iOS app can now do more with your Live Photos, thanks to the addition of rendering and advanced stabilization technology it previously rolled out in a photo editing app called \u201cMotion Stills\u201d this June. The Motion Stills app improves your Live Photos by helping you to do things like crop out the blurry frames (like when you\u2019re lifting the phone), freeze the background, create cinematic pans, stabilize the images, and more.\nIt can also turn Apple\u2019s\u00a0proprietary Live Photos format into more easily shareable looping movies.\nGoogle borrowed much of what it learned from its earlier work on video stabilization at YouTube and on other projects in order to develop Motion Stills. And for iOS users who take a lot of these animated photos, the app has been a great resource.\n\nHowever, standalone applications that perform a niche function have trouble gaining traction in today\u2019s App Store. Motion Stills, for instance, is only ranked at #717 in the \u201cPhoto & Video\u201d category on the iTunes App Store.

The Yahoo-owned blogging platform teamed up with VigLink to make this transition, which will affect all users who have not specifically opted out of affiliate links via\u00a0a new option in Tumblr\u2019s Settings.\nThe switch to affiliate links will also not affect those bloggers who are already using their own affiliate code in the links posted to their own site, notes Tumblr.\nVigLink worked to connect about 55,000 merchants to Tumblr\u2019s site, the company says. When blog\u00a0visitors click one of these new links, they\u2019re taken to a merchant\u2019s website, where they may then make a purchase. In that case, Tumblr will show up as the referrer and then receive the commission.\nTypically, when VigLink is involved in handling the rollout of affiliate links, it takes a cut of the commissions the publisher would earn, with 75% of the commission going to the publisher, and the rest kept for\u00a0itself. However, that split can vary based on things like the traffic type and size of the network, so Tumblr may have gotten a better deal.\nFor most Tumblr users, the change will likely go unnoticed \u2013 affiliate links still redirect the visitor to the same landing page. And in the case that VigLink fails to respond, Tumblr will simply forward the visitor on without an affiliate code. Meanwhile, Tumblr says it will be tracking response times to make sure that the implementation of the new links doesn\u2019t slow down its service.\nThe addition of affiliate links comes at a time when Yahoo\u00a0is trying to squeeze more money from the blogging service it overpaid for in a $1.1 billion acquisition deal in 2013.\u00a0In a call with investors this February, Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman said\u00a0Yahoo wrote down Tumblr by $230 million. This July,\u00a0Yahoo further wrote down the value of the\u00a0Tumblr acquisition by $482 million, citing lower projections for the social network\u2019s future performance.\nIn part, the writedowns are due to Yahoo\u2019s failure to meet Tumblr\u2019s perhaps too ambitious $100 million sales goal, but also because of the poor performance of publicly traded social media sites like Twitter.\nWith Verizon\u2019s deal to buy Tumblr parent Yahoo, the future of the blogging site now seems murky.\nThis is not the first change Tumblr has implemented in recent days, in terms of trying to better monetize its service. Earlier this summer, Tumblr announced it was rolling out ads across all users\u2019 blogs, too. Again, users could opt out in the Settings, but the ads \u2013 like the new affiliate links \u2013 are switched on by default.\nThe social network has now updated its Terms of Service to reflect the new monetization scheme.\nTumblr says the affiliate links will start arriving on the site in a couple of weeks.","date":"2016-09-09T07:24:37","id":1382721,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/tumblr-to-roll-out-affiliate-links-across-all-users-blogs\/","slug":"tumblr-to-roll-out-affiliate-links-across-all-users-blogs","tags":[145533,697773],"title.rendered":"Tumblr to roll out affiliate links across all users\u2019\u00a0blogs","views":343235},{"index":45,"author":31035538,"categories":[173267257,20429,17396],"content.rendered":"Beeswax, a startup founded by a trio of former Google ad executives, has raised $11 million in Series A funding.\nThe company offers what it calls a bidder-as-a-service \u2014 a set of customizable technologies that allows customers to participate in real-time bidding for ad inventory.\nBeeswax\u2019s offerings include access to inventory, bidding algorithms and analytics, but CEO Ari Paparo (previously a senior vice product of product management at AppNexus and a product director for advertiser products at Google) said what really sets the company apart is giving businesses\u00a0the ability to use Beeswax\u2019s API to customize and extend the product.\nIn Paparo\u2019s view, while digital advertising has become more\u00a0complex, the products available to advertisers \u201cfeel more like media options than technology options\u201d and are sold as a \u201cblack box.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to build something that would appeal to the CTO or CIO who wants to build on top of us and really deeply integrate,\u201d he said, adding that while large advertisers will increasingly want to build their own programmatic platforms, they aren\u2019t going to want to build them from scratch.\nFor example, Foursquare works with Beeswax \u2014 Foursquare is becoming more of an advertising business, offering its location data to help advertisers with targeting and attribution.

The only thing missing is a screen.\nThe official Pi starter kit is available to order online in the U.K. from the Foundation\u2019s distributors\u00a0element14 and RS Components, priced at \u00a399 (+VAT). While sales are slated to\u00a0open up\u00a0to markets in the rest of the world\u00a0\u201cover the next few weeks\u201d.\u00a0It\u2019s something of a full revolution for the Foundation which conceived the original Pi with the intention of inspiring schoolkids to learn programming the hard way \u2014 i.e. by trial and error and messing around with wires and cables, rather than being handed\u00a0an \u2018it just works box of bits\u2019 to plug and play.\nFour and a half years later, with more than 10 million of its single board Pi microcomputers now sold, the Foundation evidently feels it\u2019s time to put a cherry on top of the project with its own shiny white starter kit. And fair play to them.\u00a0In February last year the Pi had racked up 5 million unit sales. But the expansion of the range to the $5 price-point with Pi Zero\u00a0last November has clearly helped accelerate demand.\nThe project has also scaled wildly beyond the Foundation\u2019s\u00a0original goals, with\u00a0many a Pi finding\u00a0its way into the hands of a crafty maker or clever startup, not just\u00a0aspiring student coders. So the market for Pi will surely accommodate a premium bundle likely to\u00a0appeal to\u00a0gizmo lovers\u00a0in the Western world, while continuing to\u00a0support expanding access to computing in developing markets via the Foundation\u2019s\u00a0most affordable Pis.\nThe Foundation is\u00a0by no means the first to offer a Pi starter kit. Indeed, the lack of an official kit provided a window of opportunity for third parties\u00a0to put together Pi bundles of their own, such as London-based startup Kano which offers a bundle aimed at kids that includes not just hardware bits but its own software skin\u00a0running atop the Pi\u2019s OS with gamified elements. So while the arrival of an official kit may now squeeze out some players, there\u2019s likely to continue to be room for a range of specialized\u00a0starter kits targeting different niches.\nThe full list of items included in the official Pi starter kit is as follows:\n\nA Raspberry Pi 3 Model B\nAn 8GB NOOBS SD card\nAn official case\nAn official 2.5A multi-region power supply\nAn official 1m HDMI cable\nAn optical mouse and a keyboard with high-quality scissor-switch action\nA copy of Adventures in Raspberry Pi Foundation Edition","date":"2016-09-09T04:54:44","id":1382701,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/raspberry-pi-finally-offers-an-official-starter-kit-after-passing-10m-sales\/","slug":"raspberry-pi-finally-offers-an-official-starter-kit-after-passing-10m-sales","tags":[1382984,2428084,1896567,49695267,56661568],"title.rendered":"Raspberry Pi finally offers an official starter kit after passing 10M\u00a0sales","views":14896},{"index":48,"author":59254947,"categories":[25515],"content.rendered":"Africa\u2019s artists have a new online stage to showcase their talent. Nigeria based digital entertainment startup Iroko has launched IrokoX, a multi-platform Pan-African network for filmmakers, musicians, and other creative aspirants to produce, distribute, and monetize short-form content.\nThe new medium will provide select artists production assistance, studio resources, and the opportunity to show their work on global partner networks such as Youtube, iTunes, and Google Play. IrokoX also provides Africa\u2019s creative set a platform to digitally monetize their 3-5 minute video shorts.\n\u201cIt\u00a0 will operate on an 80\/20 split revenue share model for the majority of users\u2014the artists get 80 percent,\u201d said IrokoX General Manager Oluchi Enuha. \u201cWe are going after something akin to a Maker Studios, whereby Africa\u2019s professional and semi-professional creators can produce quality digital content, market it, share it with larger audiences, and get paid,\u201d he said, referring to the U.S. based multi-channel network purchased by Disney for $500 million in 2014.\nBacked by $35 million in funding from investors such as Kinnevik and Tiger Global, IrokoX\u2019s parent, Iroko, was founded by Nigerian entrepreneur Jason Njoku in 2010.\nIroko\u2019s new short-form video platform compliments its existing iroking Afrobeat download site and signature irokotv product\u2014a subscription based movie-on-demand service with users in over 100 countries.\nirokotv claims the title of largest global distributor of African content, most of it from Nigeria\u2019s Nollywood film industry, which is second in the world by volume. It is also a competitor to Netflix, which entered Africa in 2016.\nIn 2014, Iroko established ROK Studios, headquartered in Lagos, to produce its own film and television content.\niRoko editing teams\nIrokoX will soon leverage these facilities, and Iroko\u2019s New York and London offices, when it selects a round of artists from its first open call. \u201cWe\u2019ll launch a link this month where anyone can apply. Musicians, fashion designers, journalists, anyone can submit a demo and follow the application process,\u201d said Enuha.\nIrokoX will then pair selected artists to production resources, sponsorship, and distribution channels. Iroko is already Youtube\u2019s largest content partner in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to a company release.\nSo how will IrokoX generate the revenue for its 80\/20 split? \u201cWe\u2019ll draw on several streams: ad revenue, distribution platform sales with download sites such as iTunes and Spotify, content syndication with third party mobile and social media platforms, and brand marketing deals,\u201d said Enuhu.\nIn recent years Africa\u2019s music and movie-stars have become powerful promotional conduits for consumer goods companies. Big brands such as Uber, MTN, and Guinness have used sponsorship of musicians, actors, and entertainment to connect with the continent\u2019s growing consumer classes\u2014expected to spend $75billion online by 2025, according to McKinsey Consulting.\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country and largest economy, has become a powerhouse for the continent\u2019s creative content, producing pop music and Nollywood films with broad Pan-African appeal.\nIn 2014, the combined value of Nigeria\u2019s music and movie sector was estimated at $5 billion\u2014though less than 1 percent of it came from official revenue streams, according to the Nigerian government. Lax IP enforcement and pirating have made it difficult for financiers, producers, and artists in the continent\u2019s largest entertainment market to recoup investments and make money.\nDigital platforms such as Iroko\u2019s have offered a remedy to Africa\u2019s creative industry distribution and monetization woes. Through iroking, videos by Nigerian artists such as P-Square and Flavour regularly gain 20 million plus YouTube hits. In 2015, Iroko paid out $550,000 to content partners and generated 1.5 billion views through all of its distribution deals.\n\nThough Africa\u2019s current low internet penetration (around 30 percent) creates a challenging environment for online entertainment networks, prospects for digital content on the continent are looking up.\nAfrica has one of the world\u2019s fastest growing youth populations, broadband access is increasing and data costs coming down, and smartphone users are expected to top 720 million by 2020, according to GSMA.\nIrokoX General Manager Oluchi Enuha sees upside for the new network in the short and long-term. \u201cWe are aware of this improving environment and expect much of our viewership to come from mobile,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s decreasing, the costs of mobile data is still high for many. That shifts a lot of people to online video, YouTube, and short form content.

At that point there were just 22 employees left at Fisker, many continuing to work\u00a0without pay, all for the hope of\u00a0salvaging the design for the dream car\u00a0and one day coming back with a vengeance.\nFrom the ashes of Fisker has arisen a rebranded company named Karma, with the $130k 2017\u00a0Revero serving as its six-figure Messiah.\n\nDuring an official\u00a0press launch event today down in Orange County, I was left entirely speechless as one of the main company executives began crying at the start\u00a0of his PowerPoint presentation when\u00a0he talked\u00a0about what the car meant to him personally. In a world of tech reporting where Silicon Valley\u2019s Gavin Belson often seems\u00a0less a parody than a mirror, this display felt disarmingly\u00a0genuine and representative of the entrepreneurial sacrifice endured by the small team (which has grown back to nearly 1,000 employees) that has spent the last four years rebuilding and recrafting a new\u00a0brand and identity for the Fisker Karma.\nThough the Karma Revero itself may fit the mold of the future-conscious electric hybrid bent on ushering in a new era of car connectivity, luxury and design are\u00a0undoubtedly the more dominant genes in its DNA. The company spent a good deal of its time today with the\u00a0audience of seasoned\u00a0auto reporters and, alternatively, myself, dissecting exactly what the buyer of its\u00a0$130k Revero looked like.\nSpoiler alert: really rich.\nKarma executives admitted\u00a0that this vehicle did not have\u00a0universal\u00a0appeal by any means, and furthermore that the total\u00a0consumer\u00a0market they were targeting was perhaps only 200-300 thousand people in size. These owners are people with at least a couple other luxury cars in their garage who want a car that turns heads while being a blast to drive.\n\nThe execs\u00a0spent a good deal of time in its presentation alluding to\u00a0how the 2012 Fisker Karma, like a beautiful woman, was timeless and needed only new dressings and jewelry to attract the gazes of its (primarily male) buyers.\u00a0This didn\u2019t stop throughout the presentation as title slides showing off new UI bells and whistles were actually labeled things like \u201cnew jewelry.\u201d The comparisons\u00a0from the fleet of male executives seemed a bit\u00a0tone deaf, but to be fair, at one point an exec also compared the vehicle\u00a0to Brad Pitt so maybe they all just really want to bang\u00a0this car.\nLike a beautiful Brad Pitt, the Revero\u2019s looks haven\u2019t changed a ton from\u00a02012, just a few nips and tucks here and there. The \u201cmoustache\u201d grille has received some slight alterations and just below them the body of the car has received some more slight alterations to the unique\u00a0diamond-shaped vents.\nAll-in-all it really still is a stunning design.\nOn the more technical side, this vehicle has a 260-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine from GM and boast a\u00a021.4 kWh battery that gives the electric hybrid\u00a0about 50 miles of range. The most significant\u00a0spec improvement from a performance standpoint seems to be its Sport Mode 0-60 time, which has dropped a second to 5.4 seconds.\nFor Revero buyers, the electric hybrid seems more about embracing trends in connectivity and efficiency without having to dive head-first into the cult of Tesla in what luxury buyers\u00a0might see more as a political statement than a personal statement.\nKarma Chief Revenue Officer Jim Taylor described the very conscientious\u00a0moves to stress\u00a0the image of the Revero as a\u00a0relaxed driving car over being\u00a0a technical device. He described how many Fisker owners\u00a0saw the Tesla as \u201can iPad on wheels,\u201d and prioritized choosing\u00a0a vehicle\u00a0with the feel of a supercar alongside\u00a0some hybrid benefits, rather than the other way around.\nThe Revero\u2019s status as an electric hybrid largely seems to be merely an added perk to owners, attaching an\u00a0image of innovation to the vehicle\u2019s much more important signature luxury design.\nCase in point is\u00a0the Revero\u2019s solar roof panel, which, for all its prettiness is much more about the image it conjures than the performance it brings. The solar roof\u00a0is capable of adding up to 1.5 miles of drive distance to the battery, which frankly isn\u2019t a ton considering the fanfare directed towards the feature.\n\nKarma has gone to greater lengths to ensure that the connectivity of the car adheres more to the lifestyle of its owners. The vehicle will have CarPlay integration at launch with Android Auto support coming later. The dashboard \u201cinfotainment\u201d UI has been completely revamped based on a design drawing influence from diamonds and stuff in a package that is much more responsive and snappy than the 2012 Fisker Karma\u2019s sluggish central display.\u00a0Over-the-air updates will deliver\u00a0upgrades to the infotainment system as well as the overall vehicle firmware.\nAll of these features ultimately unite to create a car that\u00a0doesn\u2019t appear to be a radical upgrade from the 2012 Fisker Karma, but is instead more of a declaration of Karma\u2019s renewed staying power as a luxury car brand under new ownership.\nNotably, the company\u00a0seems to have legitimately no idea when this car will be ready to ship, saying that they\u2019re taking their time to perfect the vehicle. Nevertheless, the company\u00a0is currently taking pre-orders for the vehicle.","date":"2016-09-09T00:26:26","id":1382633,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/karma-looks-to-mount-a-comeback-with-the-revero-its-130k-hybrid-electric-sports-car\/","slug":"karma-looks-to-mount-a-comeback-with-the-revero-its-130k-hybrid-electric-sports-car","tags":[449552064],"title.rendered":"Karma looks to mount a comeback with the Revero, its $130k hybrid electric sports\u00a0car","views":223799},{"index":50,"author":88203759,"categories":[449223024,17396],"content.rendered":"When Apple announced the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 earlier this week\u00a0the company\u00a0said pre-orders would start\u00a0Friday September 9th, which in recent years has meant as early as 12:01am Pacific Time or 3:01am Eastern Time on the 9th.\nThis year is no different, as the company just flipped the switch on its retail website as well as in the Apple Store app, so customers can now start placing\u00a0pre-orders for both devices. As usual, carriers like AT&T and Verizon are also both accepting pre-orders, as well as newcomers Best Buy and Target this year.\nThe iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 will officially be available on September 16th, and if this year is similar to years past, those that pre-ordered early will be able to pick up or receive delivery of their device on launch\u00a0day.\nIt\u2019s always a little tough to say how exactly these pre-orders will go, as some years pre-order stock\u00a0has lasted throughout the entire day, and other years it was gone within an hour or two.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Apple won\u2019t be disclosing\u00a0sales numbers from opening weekend and pre-order sales as it has done in the past.

The $20 million infusion comes from Asana and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna.\nSeveral funds, PACs, and Democratic organizations supporting Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign have received a combined donation of $20 million. In a post titled \u201cCompelled to Act\u201d,\u00a0Moskovitz explains the donation, saying, \u201cIf Secretary Clinton wins the election, America will advance much further toward the world we hope to see,\u201d which is one that of \u201cincreased tolerance, diversity and interdependence in the name of mutual prosperity.\u201d\nThe League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund and For Our Future PAC, two organizations focused on environmental and labor issues, will each receive $5 million, while the other $10 million will go to\u00a0the DSCC, the DCCC,\u00a0MoveOn.org Political Action,\u00a0Color Of Change PAC, as well as \u201cseveral nonpartisan voter registration and GOTV efforts.\u201d\nMoskovitz said in his post\u00a0announcing the donation that he was motivated in part by a desire to defeat Trump in the November election. \u201cIf Donald Trump wins, the country will fall backward, and become more isolated from the global community,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cThis decision was not easy, particularly because we have reservations about\u00a0anyone using large amounts of money to influence elections,\u201d Moskovitz added. \u201cThat said, we believe in trying to do as much good as we can, which in this case means using the tools available to us (as they are also available to the opposition).\u201d\nMoskovitz and Tuna have been supporting philanthropic causes with a serious focus on efficiency through Good Ventures, but this is their first presidential campaign donation. The couple are the youngest to agree to the Giving Pledge, an initiative by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that asks billionaires to give away most of their wealth to charity. Moskovitz\u2019s wealth is estimated to be approximately $10.5 billion, and Tuna has charted the couple\u2019s giving as president of Good Ventures.\nTuna explained her philanthropic interests in a 2014 Washington Post profile, saying that she wanted to invest in U.S. policy, international aid, scientific advancements and global catastrophe response. Campaign finance is new to Tuna and Moskovitz, but a bitter campaign cycle inspired them to branch out.\nThe election, Moskovitz wrote, \u201chas become a referendum on who we want to be \u2014 as individuals, as a nation and as a society. Will we be driven by fear, towards tribalism, emphasizing the things that divide us? Will we focus on how to advantage those most similar to us while building barriers to separate us from the rest of the world?\u201d\nThe $20 million donation puts Moskovitz and Tuna in the ranks of mega-donors like Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager who has reportedly put over $31.5 million into this year\u2019s campaign. Steyer focuses his donations on climate change initiatives and is the co-founder of the For Our Future PAC that received $5 million from Moskovitz and Tuna. Steyer advised the couple on their foray into political giving \u2014 prior to this, Moskovitz had only donated a little more than $5,000 to political campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission data.\nWe\u2019ll have more details soon.","date":"2016-09-08T21:42:03","id":1382638,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/a-friend-of-hillary\/","slug":"a-friend-of-hillary","tags":[31144454],"title.rendered":"Clinton campaign and Dems get $20M from Facebook co-founder Dustin\u00a0Moskovitz","views":337763},{"index":52,"author":83909839,"categories":[17396],"content.rendered":"Today\u2019s Stories\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s Airbnb\u2019s plan to fix its racism and discrimination problem\nOculus wins its first Emmy for virtual reality short film \u2018Henry\u2019\n\nTwitter now acts more like a messaging app with read receipts, typing indicators & web link previews\nGoogle will acquire Apigee for $625 million\nPok\u00e9mon Go becomes the fastest game to ever hit $500 million in revenue\n\nCredits\nWritten by: Tito Hamze, John Mannes\nHosted and edited by: Tito Hamze\nFilmed by:\u00a0Joe Zolnoski\nTeleprompter: Joe Zolnoski","date":"2016-09-08T20:00:25","id":1382585,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/crunch-report-airbnb-fights-discrimination-on-platform\/","slug":"crunch-report-airbnb-fights-discrimination-on-platform","tags":[339632284],"title.rendered":"Crunch Report | Airbnb Fights Discrimination on\u00a0Platform","views":258982},{"index":53,"author":12084649,"categories":[1559,17396],"content.rendered":"There was one slide in Tim Cook\u2019s keynote that probably made the watch industry potentates choke on their oysters St Jacques. It was a simply a clear comparison between Apple Watch sales and sales of traditional watch brands, both high and low. And it wasn\u2019t good.\nAt the bottom of the barrel was Japan\u2019s Casio, makers of heavy-duty watches designed to take on tank treads and falls from your dresser. Further up the list was Longines, a mid-level brand with a long and storied history. Then Patek Philippe under Citizen and Seiko. Near the top was Fossil, the brand most of us get for high school graduation. Then the Apple Watch. Then Rolex.\nThis list, when read with a watch lover\u2019s eye, is an outrage. It\u2019s like showing a list of car brands \u2013 Toyota, Bugatti, Ford, Mercedes \u2013 and ranking them by sales, not quality. The list would be an affront. To the watch lover \u2013 and the brands that cater to them \u2013 none of these upstarts, the Casio\u2019s, the Citizens \u2013 deserve to be on the same slide as Patek Philippe and Rolex. Omega and Cartier \u2013 mid-level brands \u2013 maybe, but not those patresfamilias of the watch industry.\nBut there they are. And that\u2019s exactly why Swiss watchmaking is doomed. And that\u2019s why more and more smaller brands are appearing to fill the yawning chasm between affordable and ludicrous.\nFirst we must understand that the watch industry is about glamour. Watches have a deep and important history and are some of the most beautiful and well-designed objects of our era. But they are also just jewelry, and expensive jewelry at that. Watch makers have built a wide network of retail \u201cdoors\u201d and they created artificial scarcity by making those doors take \u2013 not choose \u2013 product of the brand\u2019s choosing. Regional manager didn\u2019t like your store in Pittsburgh? He\u2019d make you buy ten middling watches, a few expensive but unusable bands, and maybe a few good pieces. Then retailers mark them down, give discounts to favorite customers, and place orders for \u201cgrail watches\u201d that wouldn\u2019t be filled for months or years. The Swiss watch industry, during the 1980s and 1990s even into the 2000s was in firm control of its inventory, retail sales, and profits. And times were good.\nNow watches are a commodity. Companies like Daniel Wellington and MVMT are selling millions of dollars worth of acceptable if poorly-constructed watches \u2013 thereby gutting the Swiss low-end \u2013 and with advanced manufacturing techniques we are seeing smaller brands produce mechanical timepieces. Glitzy houses like MB&F and more staid, traditional places like F.P. Journe \u2013 companies who make beautiful watches for the sake of their beauty and complexity \u2013 may make it out of this maelstrom but only in the same way vinyl producers have found a small niche with music lovers.\nDon\u2019t believe me? Check out this report from the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.\n\u201cJuly was not a strong month for Swiss watch industry exports,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe fact that there were two fewer working days this year certainly penalised the results to some extent, but that was not the determining factor because at the same time Swiss exports were higher overall. The industry saw the value of its exports lose 14.2% compared to July 2015 at 1.6 billion francs.\u201d\nThe media is piling on. CNBC writes \u201cIs time being called on the watch industry as a reliable source of income for Switzerland?\u201d\n\nIt gives me no pleasure in stating any of this except for a small surge of schadenfreude: barring some miracle this line will fall and fall. In short, their hubris did them in.\nMany would claim Tim Cook\u2019s slide is bogus. Rolex doesn\u2019t publish sales numbers but we can estimate the company is making and selling about a million watches a year making it hardly the rarified brand that most watch neophytes think it is. If Rolex is the brand to beat, and you can be certain they want you to think so, then in a few months Apple will beat it handily.\nWhy? Because people don\u2019t need watches but Apple understands why they want them. Quality workmanship is the first leg on Apple\u2019s little watchmaking stool followed by a wide range of well-made accessories. Functionality is the third leg. Can your Rolex tell you the temperature in Cupertino? You may not care on a daily basis but if you\u2019re about to take a red-eye an Apple Watch is far better than a Rolex at telling you whether to bring a coat.\nAs I\u2019ve said again and again, watchmakers brought this upon themselves. To create an air of exclusivity they jacked up prices and created artificial shortages. They ignored the Internet until it was far too late and ignored their true market \u2013 the watch obsessives who visit sites like ABlogToWatch and Hodinkee and post wrist shots on Reddit. Samsung even brought on, in its own, ham-handed way, an editor from one of those sites in order to steal some of the panache from the Swiss brands. Sadly, if things keep heading this way the only things those obsessive sites will write about are Samsung and Apple smartwatches.\nThe thing that really hurts? The Glycine Airman was once the watch to wear pilots in the early 20th century. It had a 24-hour dial and could tell two timezones at once. The Airman rode on the wrists of airline captains and helicopter pilots and there some examples so worn by use and abuse \u2013 yet still ticking \u2013 that you wonder how they survived. The watch had a story.\nLast month Invicta \u2013 a brand more at home on QVC than in anyone\u2019s collection \u2013 bought Glycine. It was a fire sale. And it will happen again and again until there\u2019s nothing left.

Every day, it loses value to inflation. To generate better returns, you could keep the bare minimum in your checking account and invest the rest.

AI will make this struggle a thing of the past.\nAdvances in AI will create a robo-accountant that knows your spending better than you do. By analyzing your purchase history, it will constantly move money between your checking, savings, investments and credit cards. This way, your checking account\u2019s balance is always in the narrow \u201csweet spot:\u201d high enough to avoid fees, but not so high that you miss out on investment yield.\nRight now, finding that sweet spot is time-consuming and anxiety-inducing. In time, the robo-accountant will know when you\u2019re likely to splurge. It will know when your car will need a repair, when your electric bill will spike. It will know when you\u2019re actually better off carrying a balance on your credit card than paying your bank\u2019s minimum-balance fee.\nA fee-minimizer\/yield-optimizer could exist without AI, but it wouldn\u2019t work that well. AI incorporates the ability to make complex judgments based on your history of spending habits, the fees from your various financial institutions and countless other factors.

Because they eschewed traditional investors in favor of a series of\u00a0Kickstarter campaigns, I decided to take a closer look at how the team makes\u00a0it work.\nThere are a few companies that have built successful businesses\u00a0around repeat Kickstarter performances. Pebble, for example, has come a long way from its original $10 million Kickstarter campaign. Between it, Pebble Time\u00a0and its\u00a0Pebble 2\u00a0campaign, the company made\u00a0$43 million worth of sales from the platform.\nPeak Design feels different from the other Kickstarter Most Funded alumni. One of the biggest differences from its peers is that the company has chosen not to\u00a0take external investment \u2014 and not for lack of offers.\n\u201cI feel that if we take external investment, we would be letting the backers down to a degree,\u201d says Peter Dering, the company\u2019s founder. When pressed, he won\u2019t say that the company won\u2019t ever take investment, but the status quo is that he still owns 100 percent of the company, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter as much to him. The customers, though, that\u2019s a different story. \u201cIt would be a bitter pill to swallow for some of our earliest backers. There are people who genuinely care and who know how special it is not to have investors.\u201d\nPeter Dering, founder of Peak Design, with a mold for the company\u2019s Capture Pro product.\u00a0You\u2019d have thought a photography equipment manufacturer could get a photo of its founder in focus, eh?\nThe original Capture Clip was where Peak Design\u2019s story began.\nIt started with a clip\nThe story of Peak Design started when Dering was traveling. Wanting to have his camera available at all times, he was securing his camera to a strap on his backpack using a carabiner. It worked, but wasn\u2019t ideal, and it got him thinking\u2026 shouldn\u2019t there be a better way of carrying around a camera?\nThe idea of having a camera tripod-compatible carrying clip came up, but there was a problem\u2026\n\u201dI spent six months designing the first prototype, made out of wood. My problem was that I didn\u2019t know anyone who had brought a product to market before,\u201d Dering says, admitting that he made things up as he went along.\n\u201cMy breakthrough happened when I was traveling cross-country from California to New York. I was on a hike and met Dave Stoltz, who works as a machinist,\u201d Dering tells me. The two got to talking, and \u2014 long story short \u2014 before long, Dering had his first metal prototype. \u201cIt just worked. It worked so much better than I could have ever dreamed of.\u201d\nWith the first metal prototype done, a lot of the heavy lifting was done, but the product still needed to find a way to market somehow. Which was when a second coincidence struck home.\n\u201cThe TikTok+LunaTik campaign raised just under a million dollars around the time that I was trying to figure out how to get the Capture Clip to market,\u201d Dering says, referring to the late 2010 Kickstarter campaign\u00a0for a product that turns an iPod Nano into a wearable. \u201cIt really moved the needle; three people told me about the campaign in the same week. It made me realize that Kickstarter was the missing piece of the puzzle.\u201d\nThe Capture Clip campaign\u00a0was launched in May of 2011 and raised $360,000\u00a0\u2014 well above the $10,000 goal Dering was targeting.\n\u201cI can\u2019t really look at the video anymore,\u201d Dering laughs. \u201cI made it in Windows MovieMaker 7\u2026 Let\u2019s just say we\u2019ve come a long way since then.\u201d\nLate-night design in progress at Peak Design\u2019s San Francisco office.\nContinuing the Kickstarter journey\nThe Leash system introduced an innovative quick-release system for camera straps.\nWhen the idea came to do the second campaign, for the company\u2019s second set of products, the Leash and Cuff, Peak Design\u2019s team faced an interesting challenge.\nAt the time, Dering felt the platform was firmly focused on independents, dreamers and people who wanted to create something new. It wasn\u2019t clear whether it would it be okay to do a\u00a0second Kickstarter campaign.\n\u201cWe reached out to Kickstarter for guidance,\u201d says Dering, \u201cbut they made it clear they didn\u2019t want to talk to us about that. Nobody was willing to give us a definitive \u2018yes,\u2019 but on the other hand, they didn\u2019t give us a definitive \u2018no\u2019 either. We were very hesitant to do the second campaign, but in the end we decided to go for it and see what happens.\u00a0Kickstarter represented half of our revenue up to this point. It was 10 times more potent than any of our other selling techniques, and we needed the Kickstarter crowd\u2019s help to get the product to market.\u201d\nClick. Done.\n\u201cThe first campaign had everyone jumping up and down, cheering us\u00a0on,\u201d Dering explains. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to get accused of abusing the system.\u201d\nFrom the campaign\u2019s video, it\u2019s obvious that even as the campaign went live, the company had second thoughts about whether it was the right thing to do. A full 20 percent of the Kickstarter video was dedicated to explaining why the company returned to Kickstarter a second time.\nThe team needn\u2019t have worried. Although it wasn\u2019t as successful as its first campaign, the Leash and Cuff still raised a respectable chunk of cash in only 22 days \u2014 much shorter than its original 75-day campaign \u2013with $216,000 pledged from more than 3,100 backers.\u00a0Having found a successful formula, Dering slowly started hiring a team and continued running one Kickstarter campaign per year.\nPeter Dering. In focus, this time.\nNearly $15 million later\u2026\nOver its\u00a0Kickstarter campaigns, Peak Design found its stride, and continued launching better and better photography equipment. An\u00a0updated version of the company\u2019s original Capture product, the Capture Clip v2, saw $820,000 pledged, while its camera strap and hand-grip product raised $860,000\u00a0worth of pre-orders from the crowd.\nThe company\u2019s previous\u00a0campaign \u2014 its fifth \u2014 seemed to really hit the sweet spot, with a camera bag designed to also be good for\u00a0non-photographers, which netted the company a cool $4.9 million from more than 17,000 backers.\nThis was the Kickstarter campaign that smashed all of Peak Design\u2019s previous records, collecting nearly $5 million from more than 17,000 backers.\n\u201cWhat made the bag successful was a range of different things,\u201d the company\u2019s marketing boss Adam Saraceno told me. \u201cFirst of all, the bag that we make has to have some very photography-specific functionality, including the dividers and the quick access points. But, almost as importantly, it is not just a camera bag \u2014 \u200aand that was intentional. We call it the Everyday Messenger bag for a reason: We designed and marketed it around more than just the needs of a photographer.\u201d\nThe first two campaigns raised around $200k. The next two clocked in around the $750k mark. And then things started going a bit silly.\nWith a campaign that dwarfed anything the company had done before, the company had\u00a0to change gears. It started spending a lot more time with its suppliers in Vietnam.\n\u201cThe plan was never to make just photography equipment,\u201d Peter Dering explained to me. \u201cI called the company Peak Design because I wanted something with the same initials as my name. P and D. There\u2019s no \u2018photography\u2019 in the name, and that is intentional.\u201d\nBreaking another record\nFor its most recent trick in the form of a trio of bag products called the Everyday Backpack, Tote and Sling, the company returned to Kickstarter, of course. As I\u2019m writing this, the company\u2019s campaign is well over 10 times above its half-million-dollar goal.\nPeak Design\u2019s new Everyday Backpack is undeniably a ridiculously cleverly designed backpack. With a suggested retail price of $260, it had better be pretty special, too.\nDering showed me prototypes of the bags and I can see why people are excited about them. Well, all of them except the tote bag. I guess I never really saw the point of a tote bag, but then, what do I know. The company has sold almost 1,800 of them as part of its Kickstarter campaign, netting a healthy $261,000 from that product alone.\nSo, how does the company deal with operating in full view of its customers, competitors and distributors?\n\u201cIt\u2019s a choice we\u2019ve made,\u201d says Dering. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t want to do Kickstarter campaigns, we\u2019d have to raise money from somewhere. I\u2019m not a control freak, but I don\u2019t see what would be gained from giving up our freedom.\u201d\nDering is still the company\u2019s sole founder, and owns every single share of the company.\n\u201cI have given around 28 percent of the company to our staff as a \u2018phantom stock.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t mean they own part of the company, but they do share in the profits,\u201d Dering explains. \u201cI pay myself a salary that\u2019s big enough to pay for food, rent and my life. If I exceed that and want to pay myself more money out of the company\u2019s profits, I pay it out as a dividend.\u201d\nPeak Design\u2019s current Kickstarter campaign has raised more than $5 million and is gunning for the $6 million mark.\nIn other words, should Dering take $1 million off the table, he would stick $720,000 in his own account and distribute $280,000 to his staff.\n\u201cI call it a fairness doctrine,\u201d Dering explains. \u201cI live a super happy, easy, stress-free life. I want to extend that to my employees. In the meantime, when we\u2019re all in this together, I like to be at the front lines.\u201d\nClearing a different path\nI find it intriguing that Peak Design has decided to plot a different path for itself. Like so many of the other startups I write about here on TechCrunch, Peak Design\u2019s headquarters are in San Francisco. Unlike most of the other companies, Dering & Co. have few aspirations to chase valuations and unicorn status.\n\u201cNo amount of money can replace this company. I feel like we are a big family. It feels like we are in it together, all winning,\u201d Dering says. Then, pensively he adds, \u201cI\u2019ve had some shitty jobs in my time. With Peak, we\u2019re optimizing for creating awesome products and optimizing for happiness.\u201d\nOptimizing for happiness means optimizing for humor, laughter and feeling comfortable enough to be silly. I\u2019ve seen that in action whenever I\u2019ve run into the Peak Design gang at trade shows. For example, the time I came to the company\u2019s\u00a0booth and saw it covered in black plastic garbage bags, with its\u00a0products\u00a0taped to the sides of the booth.\nWorking hard? More like hardly working, amirite? Oh. You are working hard? Er, ok. My apologies. Carry on.\n\u201dThe airline lost our fucking luggage,\u201d Saraceno grumbled as I pointed at the booth behind him with a questioning shrug. \u201cLuckily our distributor had some of our stock handy and\u00a0our booth looks pretty cool like this, too.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t over-emphasize the importance of hiring genuinely funny people,\u201d Dering told me, before launching into a couple of unprintable anecdotes. He concluded: \u201cWe have some funny motherfuckers at Peak Design.\u201d\nNo two companies are the same, but I can\u2019t help but feel that Peak Design is a bit less the same than many of the others I\u2019ve run into. As long as the team is\u00a0able to keep their sense of humor about them, I expect them back on Kickstarter again next year. As for the company\u2019s product?\n\u201cHey, let me get the current campaign out of the way first,\u201d Dering retorts, refusing to even hint at what might be next. \u201cI do have 22,000 new backers to look after before we worry about our next campaign.\u201d","date":"2016-09-08T16:46:59","id":1370981,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/peak-design\/","slug":"peak-design","tags":[609795,344761,449553141],"title.rendered":"Peak Design and building a company on the Kickstarter\u00a0platform","views":455184},{"index":57,"author":99341258,"categories":[174,17396],"content.rendered":"NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has successfully launched from Cape Canaveral with the help of 1.2 million pounds of thrust provided by an Atlas V rocket. The spacecraft will journey to a near-Earth asteroid known as Bennu and return an asteroid sample to Earth. This will be NASA\u2019s first asteroid sample return mission.\nDesigned to return a sample as large as two kilograms, the mission is likely to bring back the largest sample of alien rock since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.\n\nThis mission is the first of its kind for NASA and is a uniquely difficult one.\nGrabbing a space rock and bringing it back to Earth may not seem that complicated, but mission success for OSIRIS-REx will be dependent on the execution of a number of complex maneuvers over the course of nine years.\nHere are just a few of the things that NASA\u2019s asteroid sample return mission must get right to complete a successful mission. OSIRIS-REx will need to fly toward Bennu at 12,000 mph and then pump the brakes to less than 0.5 mph to intercept the asteroid. Then, a relatively large sample will need to be collected in the tricky environment of microgravity. If that sample gets contaminated by anything the spacecraft brought from Earth, or from something else it encounters before it can be delivered to a clean room for analysis, the mission is compromised. So, OSIRIS-REx must go above and beyond to protect that sample, especially during the intense return through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nNASA isn\u2019t the first to attempt this difficult feat. The\u00a0Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (Japan\u2019s NASA-equivalent organization) launched the first asteroid sample return mission back in 2003, but things went awry once the spacecraft reached the asteroid and a large sample was unable to be collected.\nWhile a successful launch is a great first step, the OSIRIS-REx team won\u2019t be able to breathe a sigh of relief until September 2025, when the Bennu sample has successfully been brought home and analyzed.\nOSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security-Regolith Explorer, will reach the Bennu asteroid in August, 2018. Upon arrival, the spacecraft will take months to analyze the asteroid and identify a scientifically interesting section to sample.\nOSIRIS-REx surveying Bennu \/ Image courtesy of the University of Arizona\nA couple of years later, around July 2020, OSIRIS-REx will use a robotic instrument known as TAGSAM to make contact with the asteroid and shoot a burst of pure nitrogen gas at the rock. This gas will push bits of the asteroid\u2019s surface into a sampling chamber.\nThen, in March, 2021, OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to depart Bennu and begin its trip home. The spacecraft should reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in September, 2023. At that time, the sample will be delivered for two years of thorough analysis at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center.\nWhy is NASA going through all of this trouble to study an asteroid?\nWell, for one, this particular asteroid has the potential to impact Earth in the 22nd century \u2014 and it\u2019s large enough to do some damage. Because of this, there\u2019s the possibility that we may want to intercept Bennu\u00a0in the future for the purpose of deflection. So, there\u2019s benefit to flight-testing some of these capabilities now (before some people\u2019s lives depend on it).\nThere\u2019s also significant\u00a0scientific reasons for studying asteroids. Scientists believe that asteroids are primitive rocks \u2014 leftover debris from the formation of the planets in our solar system created billions of years ago.\nAs an added benefit, asteroids don\u2019t have recycling processes like we have here on Earth (wind, water, tectonic plates, etc.), so they haven\u2019t changed much since their formation, making them uniquely interesting scientific specimens.\nBecause of their historical significance, studying an asteroid like Bennu could help us understand how planets form.\nPerhaps the more interesting reason to analyze a Bennu sample is that it could help us understand how life began here on Earth. There\u2019s a theory known as panspermia that states that microbial life was carried to Earth by asteroids, meteoroids, comets or other orbiting planetary bodies. Scientists predict that Bennu contains organic materials, which is one of the ingredients for creating life as we know it.\nTo test the panspermia theory, the OSIRIS-REx team will work hard to identify a section of the Benny asteroid that contains organic material for sampling.\nNine years may sound like a long time, but NASA\u2019s most ambitious planetary spacecraft (New Horizons, Voyager, Juno, etc.) have always taken many years to complete their mission. And if everything with OSIRIS-REx goes according to plan, we may just have answers to some of the biggest questions scientists have asked about the formation of Earth and the origin of life.","date":"2016-09-08T16:41:24","id":1382574,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/nasa-has-successfully-launched-osiris-rex-their-first-asteroid-sample-return-mission\/","slug":"nasa-has-successfully-launched-osiris-rex-their-first-asteroid-sample-return-mission","tags":[10351,95774,1836,449553173],"title.rendered":"NASA has successfully launched OSIRIS-REx, their first asteroid sample return\u00a0mission","views":284681},{"index":58,"author":103597267,"categories":[15986864,17396],"content.rendered":"A former Air Force general and Department of Homeland Security official has been appointed as the first federal chief information security officer, the White House announced today.\nGregory Touhill will take charge of cybersecurity across the federal government, planning and implementing policy changes\u00a0to make the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and government agencies more secure.\nTouhill is the first person to fill the CISO role, which was announced in February as part of President Barack Obama\u2019s Cybersecurity National Action Plan and has sat vacant since then.

As one industry insider told me, there are a million ways to screw up that idea through poor execution, and many, many lose their way. Yet a precious few fight through the problems and the challenges, and somehow, with a bit of luck and a lot of moxie, make it to IPO.\nThe four original founders of Box, one of those companies that made it through that long journey, talked about their experience in a panel discussion this week at BoxWorks.\nWhile CEO Aaron Levie and CFO Dylan Smith have long been the public faces of Box, there were two others \u2014 Jeff Queisser, chief systems architect and Sam Ghods, services architect \u2014 all childhood friends in Seattle, who quit college to follow the startup dream.\nThe idea\nThe group seemed destined to launch some sort of startup, and often bounced ideas off one another, even after they went their separate ways to college. After Levie came up with the idea of what would be Box as part of a marketing class, the group saw potential \u2014 at least Smith did. Ghods\u00a0didn\u2019t see the value right away, but eventually all four were on board and Box was born.\nThese guys were living a Silicon Valley clich\u00e9 in the early days, giving birth to their idea in a dorm room, then quitting school and renting out a converted garage that acted as their office and living space. You have to remember, these were four young men in their early twenties with no business experience whatsoever, yet they fell into their roles, as Levie with some marketing classes would be CEO, Smith with his financial sensibilities became CFO, Ghods\u00a0with some coding background headed up engineering and Queisser, who had spent summers installing cable modems, became the de facto head of IT.\nBox\u2019s four founders around 2005 outside their converted garage apartment\/headquarters.\nThe core group soon began selling Box subscriptions and were making a little bit of money. They even found an early backer at DFJ, who gave them some initial funding and helped form\u00a0their fledgling board of directors.\nMoving beyond the core group\nOne of the first inflection points for any startup is when you move beyond the core group of founders and begin to look for additional employees. The core group has passion, and in the case of Box, were four guys who had grown up together, further complicating the hiring dynamic \u2014 but as with everything, they had some luck in the deal (and they have some advice for those starting on that journey now).\nThe core team knew they were looking for a good cultural fit, but they were warned don\u2019t get people who have the same exact skills and think just the way you\u00a0do because you\u00a0just get an echo chamber. Early on, any startup needs people who can cover a lot of jobs. When you get a little bigger, specialization begins to take\u00a0over.\nEven if they weren\u2019t quite sure what\u00a0they were looking for, they had a sense. They definitely had a \u201cno asshole\u201d rule and they needed someone they would be comfortable brainstorming with in a small room for hours. They lucked out when they brought in Karen Appleton as their eighth or ninth employee. She brought a level of professionalism and business experience the founders lacked, and she encouraged them to form partnerships.\n\u201cWe were 19 or 20 years old. We didn\u2019t know how it would work to hire more experienced people. Karen was the first of those hires and changed our hiring trajectory from cultural fit to cultural add,\u201d Smith explained.\nChanging direction\nOne thing that most startups do is pivot from the original idea, and Box was no exception. In about 2007, they began to recognize that consumer online storage was becoming increasingly specialized with Flickr handling photos and YouTube video. They didn\u2019t think they could compete with that, and at the same time they began to recognize a need for a file-sharing product for business.\n\u201dI had a simple rule of thumb. Bet on whatever Steve Jobs is betting on.\nThere were a lot of heavy discussions about how to proceed. Eventually Box switched to the enterprise, but\u00a0they didn\u2019t make the transition\u00a0willy-nilly. They actually went out and hired a consultant, who made some calls and gathered some data for them to confirm they were making a sound decision. You have to remember in 2007, the iPhone was just coming out and it wasn\u2019t obvious that content and collaboration would move to the cloud. The consultant confirmed that some companies were thinking about this and there would be a business in that space.\nThere was still a lot of discussion among the founders, but they eventually all agreed it was the way to go \u2014 and it turned out to be a good decision.\nA couple of years later, the iPad came out and this was a major\u00a0turning point. \u201cI had a simple rule of thumb. Bet on whatever Steve Jobs is betting on,\u201d Levie\u00a0joked. The company turned its attention to the iPad right away and was one of the first enterprise companies with an iPad app. It was then that they realized content management was changing in a big way and it was going to be about protecting content\u00a0in motion.\nIt\u2019s a learning process\nThe founders learned you need to compromise, and that was all part of the process. They also were voracious readers, and reading books like The\u00a0Innovator\u2019s Dilemma and Crossing the Chasm helped shape the company philosophy over time.\n\nThey all recommend getting mentors and learning as much as you can, because it\u2019s tough going it on your own. You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, and mentors who have been through the startup experience can help point you in the right direction \u2014 and they found when they asked, people generally wanted to help.\nThey also say there will be scary moments in the life of any company. They point to 2008 when they went looking for a Series B round in the middle of a huge economic crisis as one of those times.\nThere will also be tough times. You will definitely fight with your co-founders and you may question what you\u2019re doing, but if you believe in the core mission, you can reach the goal of becoming a public company. It worked for Box \u2014 and it\u2019s worth noting that the four founders remained close friends through it all.","date":"2016-09-08T15:40:14","id":1382516,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/its-a-long-hard-road-from-idea-to-ipo\/","slug":"its-a-long-hard-road-from-idea-to-ipo","tags":[16461990,53395,213383,20429],"title.rendered":"It\u2019s a long, hard road from idea to\u00a0IPO","views":134624},{"index":61,"author":13119829,"categories":[11160,15328,17396],"content.rendered":"Reports claim\u00a0that point-of-sale startup Revel Systems is in early acquisition negotiations with IBM, and while both Revel and IBM declined to comment when we asked about it, a deal that the startup\u00a0announced today could provide an interesting clue for\u00a0why a company like\u00a0Big Blue might be\u00a0interested in buying it.\nToday Revel announced a deal with Shell, the oil and gas giant, to implement its point-of-sale system across its retail network of gas stations globally.\nShell Retail operates\u00a043,000 sites in 70 countries\u00a0and sells 160 billion litres of fuel and $6 billion in retail sales annually. Revel\u00a0will be rolled out at these Shell businesses country-by-country. The U.S. (Shell\u2019s biggest market) is unlikely to be among the first,\u00a0Lisa Falzone, co-founder and CEO of Revel, said in an interview.\nFeatures that Revel will cover in its system built for Shell include fuel and convenience store card payments; managing pumps and fuel\u00a0inventory both straight from the iPad and remotely; loyalty programs; convenience store inventory;\u00a0and operating\u00a0in offline mode.\nThe deal\u00a0is a significant\u00a0one for a company like Revel. Similar to its many new-wave competitors in the area of point-of-sale commerce, from payments providers like Square, to those like Clover that\u00a0have been acquired by larger companies, to payment startups that are also trying to consolidate and acquire point-of-sale technology (indeed Revel is also playing the consolidation game) \u2014 Revel\u00a0has\u00a0focused largely on smaller and medium-sized businesses.\nRevel itself has installed\u00a0some 25,000 POS systems with retailers to date. Its\u00a0customers include some medium-sized businesses like the\u00a0bakery chain Cinnabon, but the majority are still in the\u00a0small-businesses category.\nRevel signing a deal with an operation the size of Shell is a sign of how smaller and more disruptive companies are starting to gain more credibility with large enterprises \u2014 a target market for large system integrators like IBM.\n\n\nRevel\u2019s POS system is typical of the shift that is underway in the world of commerce.\n\n\nDesigned to work on commercially available tablets like the iPad from Apple, software from these younger payments and POS companies is doing battle with more clunky, expensive and antiquated incumbents.\n\n\nIn its case, Revel\u2019s software\u00a0will be replacing a \u201cthirty-year-old software system,\u201d Lisa Falzone, co-founder and CEO of Revel, said in an interview. \u201cWhat we offer is not proprietary hardware,\u201d she added. \u201cOff-the-shelf hardware is so much easier to scale.\u201d\n\n\nCoincidentally,\u00a0IBM itself has a first-hand\u00a0awareness of what companies like Revel are\u00a0replacing in the market: the company in 2012 divested its own hardware-and-software POS business, selling it\u00a0to Toshiba for $850 million.\nWhile Falzone said\u00a0that she \u201ccan\u2019t confirm or deny\u201d if\u00a0IBM is working on a deal to buy Revel, it\u2019s interesting to consider that IBM\u00a0has been making some other key acquisitions to speed up its move away from its legacy business in other areas, as well, for example in cloud computing to offset declines in\u00a0its legacy server business.\nRevel\u2019s solution for Shell will be based around iPad devices, which is another interesting crossover for IBM, which has been in a partnership with Apple since 2014 to develop more enterprise apps for iPad devices, one\u00a0route to selling more of Apple\u2019s hardware into those businesses.\n\u201cWith Revel Systems we are implementing new tablets and payment options that are easy to use, innovative and will improve the customer experience so that customers keep coming back to Shell,\u201d said Maggie van\u2019T Hoff, CIO, Shell Retail, in a statement.\nTo date, Revel Systems, which was founded in 2010,\u00a0said that it has raised more than $130 million in funding, with investors including DCM Ventures, Roth Capital and private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe.","date":"2016-09-08T15:21:08","id":1382281,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/revel-shell\/","slug":"revel-shell","tags":[63860,45031,58586340,43912],"title.rendered":"Revel Systems inks payments deal with Shell as rumors swirl of a sale to\u00a0IBM","views":299618},{"index":62,"author":15157806,"categories":[447971118,15986864,449223024,449546991,17396,2401],"content.rendered":"Alphabet\u2019s innovation lab\u00a0X\u00a0has a drone-focused team called Project Wing which has just announced a plan to commence aerial burrito delivery, in partnership with Chipotle, on the campus of Virgina Tech next week.\nProject Wing\u2019s mission it to make fully autonomous, or self-flying drones, that can deliver anything to anyone. But the X team is focused, for now, on delivering small packages in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nIt made a first run in 2014 in Queensland, Australia, delivering a first aid kit, candy bars, dog treats and water to farmers.\nThe burrito delivery that will begin next week is not open to the public, and is just a test of the service.\nVirginia Tech is home to a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration test site, which is run by the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership.\nThe MAAP is authorized to conduct projects using unmanned aerial systems at Virginia Tech with the express purpose of researching and gathering data that it will share with federal authorities.

Students and employees will be invited to participate in the tests, ordering from a kiosk and waiting in a designated area for their food.\nChipotle will have a food truck on site where it will prepare the orders.\nThe Wing drones (unmanned aerial systems) will hover above a designated delivery area and lower the burritos in their packaging to the ground.\nThe tests are expected to generate data on \u201cnavigational accuracy and vehicle performance,\u201d to be provided to the FAA, according to a press statement from Virginia Tech.\nChipotle executives were not immediately available to comment.

Amid concerns over\u00a0cord-cutting, the rise of time-shifted viewing and the unstoppable growth of digital and mobile platforms, the value of sports rights remains unquestioned. However, the industry remains ripe for change.\nThe unique eccentricities of the sports industry \u2014 where the focus has typically been on improving the performance of the athletes and the size of sponsorship deals \u2014 have held back progress as the broader business world has benefited from a wave of tech-enabled productivity gains.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe, but in the world of cricket, many sports associations and bodies continue to record their assets (in this instance, the \u201ccricket match\u201d) on paper and have no way of directly communicating with their customers. And while the national governing boards invest in technology to improve the performance of their teams, it\u2019s not being leveraged to identify future stars and fans early. Ultimately, they should be managing their customers from cradle to grave \u2014 i.e. from when they first start playing or watching the sport right through their lives as fans.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing major sports leagues is the flat-lining growth in home markets, where demographic expansion is slowing; population growth has virtually flat-lined in Europe, while rising at a mere\u00a00.77 percent in the U.S.\nMeanwhile, the emerging markets offer both vast audiences (more than 2.5 billion consumers in China and India alone) and an emerging middle-class with an interest in western culture and sports. Whilst sports leagues are increasingly scheduling friendlies and regular-seasonal games in overseas markets, the opportunity to engage a global fan base using digital and social platforms is enormous.\nEven as political and economic uncertainties foster a more cautious investment climate in the broader technology industry, the passion of sports fans will endure. \nIndeed, the world of sports media and broadcasting is now experiencing major seismic changes. With more than\u00a01.7 billion monthly active users on Facebook,\u00a0and many millions more on other social channels around the world, there is an incredible opportunity for all manner of sports to reach a vast global audience \u2014\u00a0Facebook alone has 500 million \u201chardcore\u00a0football fans.\u201d\u00a0But the greatest beneficiaries may turn about to be the smaller sports properties, whose avid fan bases are underserved by linear broadcast and cable TV. This will no doubt have a profound impact on women\u2019s sports, for example.\nSocial media is also advancing the experience for viewers of prime-time sports fixtures, providing an additional and complementary experience outside of sports events. The\u00a0NHL\u2019s partnership with\u00a0GoPro\u00a0to provide hockey fans with a \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d look at the game is one of a growing number of examples of how social media is bringing fans closer to the action both on and off the ice\/pitch\/field. Of course, the emergence of VR, too,\u00a0will have fascinating implications for sports fans all over the world.\nThe sports-betting industry has long been a key contributor to the sports industry and an important part of the sports experience for many fans. According to some reports, the\u00a0global sports-betting industry is worth more than $3 trillion,\u00a0although much of this is currently illegal.\nInterestingly, we are also now seeing greater flexibility from regulators; as a result, new opportunities are emerging \u2014 the\u00a0best-known\u00a0example being fantasy sports and the meteoric rise of\u00a0DraftKings\u00a0and\u00a0FanDuel, both now thought to be worth\u00a0over a billion dollars. The digitization of the sports industry will generate an explosion of\u00a0data that can be sliced and diced by fans.\nThe stars of sports look set to reap the rewards of this digital transformation. While the rising value of sports rights and globalization of sports are already driving pay packages higher for athletes, it is the power and influence of leading athletes on digital platforms that will change industry dynamics forever.\nFootball stars can have larger audiences than the clubs they play for, and vastly outnumber the reach of traditional broadcasters in some countries \u2014 Cristiano Ronaldo alone has\u00a0more than 116 million Facebook fans. Indeed, it was the sponsorship deals with athletes that made Beats headphones a global success story and led to the\u00a0acquisition by Apple for $3 billion.\n\nAthletes are increasingly looking beyond traditional endorsement deals and seeking exposure to the success of\u00a0startups, including New England Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady, who inked a deal with Under Armour that included equity, while English Premier League footballers\u00a0Cesc F\u00e0bregas,\u00a0Thierry Henry,\u00a0Robin van\u00a0Persie\u00a0and NBA star\u00a0Tony Parker are all\u00a0investors in social video\u00a0startup\u00a0Grabyo\u00a0\u2014 a company featured at TechCrunch Disrupt London last December and which is well positioned to benefit from media consumption trends.\u00a0Two former New Zealand cricket captains, Stephen Fleming and Brendon\u00a0McCullum, are foundation investors, with others making subsequent investments \u2014 their involvement was particularly helpful in the early days of our company. And Kobe Bryant is now taking it one step further with the launch of a $100 million venture capital fund with partner Jeff Stibel; current investments include sports media website The Players\u2019 Tribune.\nEven as political and economic uncertainties foster a more cautious investment climate in the broader technology industry, the passion of sports fans will endure. In a sector that is ripe for change, and with major technology trends driving a more immersive sports experience, it brings great opportunity. With the next billion sports fans also now emerging in markets like China and India, it will be fascinating to see how this industry changes over the next decade.","date":"2016-09-08T14:00:07","id":1380139,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/the-transformation-of-sport-will-bring-rich-rewards\/","slug":"the-transformation-of-sport-will-bring-rich-rewards","tags":[4003605,17376654,420599855,27141],"title.rendered":"The transformation of sport will bring rich\u00a0rewards","views":92127},{"index":66,"author":24878080,"categories":[449549093,426985170,17396],"content.rendered":"This year\u2019s TechCrunch Disrupt SF Hackathon is set to be the best yet.

Phil Suarez, who partnered with French chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten to launch well-known restaurants including ABC Kitchen and the eponymous Jean-Georges, led the new funding.\nFounded by Shu Chowdhury, Salido started out as a point-of-sale system for restaurants and has expanded to a broader set of tools that allows restaurants to manage their customer data, their workforce and their inventory. Chowdhury said that at first, this approach \u201cwas very unpopular because it wasn\u2019t sexy,\u201d but it\u2019s become more compelling, particularly because of the comprehensive data that Salido has been able to collect.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to fix the inside of the restaurant,\u201d Chowdhury said. \u201cWe know that the feature set and the data model that we\u2019ve built addresses the needs of the restaurant. We don\u2019t believe reservations is a business, it\u2019s a feature. We don\u2019t believe ordering is a business, it\u2019s a feature.\u201d\nFor example, he said that Salido has restaurants\u2019 menu information, \u201cI can easily open it up to online ordering,\u201d which can also mean connecting with reservation systems like OpenTable.\nIn addition to working with high-end restaurants, Salido also has customers from the more casual side, including Num Pang and \u2018Wichcraft. Chowdhury isn\u2019t saying how many restaurants Salido is currently working with, but he did note that the system has processed $27 million to date for more than 1 million total guests.","date":"2016-09-08T13:31:46","id":1382493,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/salido-phil-suarez\/","slug":"salido-phil-suarez","tags":[1662,419141540,419211926],"title.rendered":"Restaurant tech startup Salido raises\u00a0$2M","views":212958},{"index":68,"author":89646803,"categories":[17396],"content.rendered":"Actev Motors, a young, Mountain View, Ca.-based company, is gearing up to ship its eagerly anticipated all-electric smart go-karts beginning this fall.\nThe vehicles, for kids ages 5 to 9, cost roughly $1,000, including a Formula One-like body kit that comes in silver or red, and shipping.\u00a0They come with a\u00a0lot of neat features that tech-savvy parents will appreciate, too, including an app that lets parents adjust the speed at which their kids are driving (up to 12 miles per hour), a geofencing function that keeps kids within a particular boundary and collision avoidance, so junior won\u2019t run into the neighbor\u2019s house.\n\nRecently, we toured the company\u2019s offices, where it fabricates and tests out what looks to be a growing line of products.\nIn fact, if all goes as planned \u2014\u00a0Actev is raising a Series A round currently\u00a0\u2014\u00a0its next major product line will center on a go-kart for grown-ups.\nCEO Dave Bell, who founded the company with Tony Fadell (of Apple and Nest Labs fame), declined to share specifics\u00a0about how many pre-orders the company has taken or exactly when the karts will reach customers\u2019 homes, but we gather they\u2019ll be arriving in driveways in the next month or two.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t#gallery-1381167-1 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1381167-1 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1381167-1 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1381167-1 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/","date":"2016-09-08T13:22:49","id":1381167,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/actev-motors-cofounded-by-tony-fadell-prepares-to-start-shipping-its-smart-go-karts\/","slug":"actev-motors-cofounded-by-tony-fadell-prepares-to-start-shipping-its-smart-go-karts","tags":[449553161,1233742],"title.rendered":"Actev Motors, co-founded by Tony Fadell, prepares to start shipping its smart\u00a0go-karts","views":104239},{"index":69,"author":321129,"categories":[25515,11160,17396],"content.rendered":"Walmart\u2019s latest earnings report wasn\u2019t pretty. Overall revenue growth came in at a tepid 0.7 percent for the first half of the fiscal year. Its\u00a0e-commerce sales grew 11.8 percent, but the total e-commerce market is tearing ahead at 15 percent quarterly growth, which means they\u2019re actively losing that market. Oh, and it\u00a0bought Jet.com, a massively unprofitable e-commerce vendor, for $3.3 billion to make up for it.\u00a0So how did the market react? Walmart\u2019s stock spiked 3\u00a0percent. I guess in today\u2019s retail market, you win by not losing.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a world without Walmart. Ninety percent of all Americans live within 20 minutes of a Wal-Mart store. They have over 1.5 million employees at 5000 stores, and serve over 140 million shoppers a week.\u00a0But the too-little-too-late move by Walmart\u00a0to acquire\u00a0Jet.com is yet another signal that we are witnessing the downward spiral of a $230 billion company. A world without Walmart is now not only possible, but likely, unless it\u00a0makes some big moves soon.\nSo here\u2019s an idea: Turn half of those superstores into integrated online fulfillment centers, with local pickup and delivery services, but no more customers walking through the front door. That\u2019s the only way Walmart is going to find out who its customers really are.\nI get it. Brick-and-mortar infrastructure is vastly different from e-commerce infrastructure. You don\u2019t just flip a few switches and turn a giant retail store into a provisioning warehouse (though you could argue that most big box stores are just huge, confusing warehouses anyway).\nBut Walmart needs to triage its general merchandise business now, before it winds up dying on the vine with the rest of the retail market. And the best way to know your customer is over the internet. Retail needs to flip the script \u2014 the online experience has to come first.\nRight now e-commerce might represent only 10 percent of total retail sales, but in 10\u00a0years, is anyone going to be driving five miles to a supercenter to buy toothpaste and shampoo?\u00a0Walmart needs to make some systemic changes soon in order to challenge Amazon\u2019s real killer IP \u2014 customer insight.\nWalmart has been selling online for the last 15 years. But Walmart doesn\u2019t know anything about you when you walk into one of its superstores. It\u2019s got some pick-up delivery options and some loyalty payment gateways, but e-commerce is still just 3\u00a0percent of its\u00a0business.\nToday over half of American households subscribe to Amazon Prime. Now, what does Amazon know about its\u00a0customers? Everything. It knows the entirety of their\u00a0browsing activity and their purchase history (the first book you ever ordered on Amazon is sitting right there in your order history \u2013 go look it up). Also note that Amazon currently has two-hour delivery in two dozen metropolitan areas, and same-day delivery in many more. Today\u2019s novelty services will become tomorrow\u2019s table stakes.\nAmazon doesn\u2019t deal in customer segments; it deals in customers.\n\nAll that helps explain why it recently became the world\u2019s fourth-largest public company, joining Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and kicking Exxon Mobil down the list. It\u2019s not a coincidence that those first four companies are hugely successful at wrapping ongoing services around unique subscriber IDs, while the fifth one sells you gas. Walmart is trying to buy itself into that subscriber ID club with Jet.com, but it\u2019s too little, too late.\nToday\u2019s consumers are looking for more than coupons, free samples, and blue light specials. They expect businesses to know them, understand their needs, and build customized offerings and services around this knowledge so they can have the products they want, when they want them, and how they want them. They want products to just happen.\nWalmart needs to start orienting itself around a future in which e-commerce will become the dominant retail channel. It needs to start learning who its customers are. It needs to put those greeters in delivery vans.","date":"2016-09-08T13:00:14","id":1380617,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/to-compete-against-amazon-walmart-should-cut-itself-in-half\/","slug":"to-compete-against-amazon-walmart-should-cut-itself-in-half","tags":[6602,15387],"title.rendered":"To compete with Amazon, Walmart should cut itself in\u00a0half","views":466083},{"index":70,"author":13978192,"categories":[4213,2024,2401],"content.rendered":"SpotHero is not new to the on-demand parking game. It raised $2.5 million in 2012, and another $20 million in Series B funding in 2015. This for a service that allows drivers to prepay for a parking space in a garage via app before the car ever leaves the driveway.\n\u201cYou can reserve a spot for three hours or three days,\u201d said SpotHero co-founder and CEO Mark Lawrence, \u201cand you can make the reservation for right this minute or in two weeks.\u201d You just scan your phone when you enter the garage and scan it again when you leave. You know where you\u2019re parking and how much you\u2019re going to pay \u2014 no driving around and no surprises.\nWhile this is all very convenient today, Lawrence has his sights set on the future of driving, or not driving, as the case may be. Right now, the human interfaces with the phone, which interfaces with the online garage. In the future, the car will take the place of the human to connect with SpotHero, which connects with the garage to reserve and pay for the space.\n\u201cIt could be an algorithm that says, \u2018I need this autonomous pod or car to be stored for x amount of time,\u2019 and it will run some calculations,\u201d Lawrence said in our phone interview. \u201cThe algorithm will check to see if it can park farther for cheaper, and take traffic into account.\u201d\nThe challenge, today and tomorrow, is that the garages have to be online for this to work, whether it\u2019s a human or a car that wants to connect. \u201cParking facilities have to be online or they\u2019re invisible,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to capture the largest share unless they\u2019re visible. Let\u2019s get these facilities online and make them available for ecommerce.\u201d\nSpotHero has a sales and marketing team tasked with increasing parking companies\u2019 awareness of this source of revenue. The team takes a rising tide lifts all boats approach: \u201cWe say, \u2018Here are all the interfaces out there; it\u2019s not just SpotHero,'\u201d Lawrence said. The team has to educate the parking companies on the tools available and the scanning and redemption technology required for future-proofing their businesses. \u201cOtherwise, how are they going to communicate with consumers right now and also with cars that drive themselves in the future?\u201d\nWe dove into the futuristic idea of electric autonomous pods during our conversation, which Lawrence acknowledged is an \u201cangelic view.\u201d Electric cars are more efficient than gasoline, but much of the grid in the United States is still powered by coal, and \u201cthere need to be macro changes before EVs on a grand scale are possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even when the energy issue is solved, parking isn\u2019t going to go away. Cities don\u2019t want empty vehicles just roaming around.\u201d\nHe\u2019s predicting those futuristic vehicles will need to park themselves when not in use, and SpotHero will be ready to make the connection.","date":"2016-09-08T11:59:13","id":1382454,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/spothero-is-ready-for-the-future-of-autonomous-parking\/","slug":"spothero-is-ready-for-the-future-of-autonomous-parking","tags":[419944026,93983,10363,53304683],"title.rendered":"SpotHero is ready for the future of autonomous\u00a0parking","views":282745},{"index":71,"author":8102444,"categories":[17396],"content.rendered":"Following yesterday\u2019s\u00a0iPhone 7 announcement, Apple is announcing that new AppleCare+ members will be able to get their cracked screens fixed for $29.\u00a0This is big news for everyone who uses an iPhone with AppleCare+, and ultimately, anyone who owns an iPhone to begin with.\nIt\u2019s worth noting how much AppleCare+ costs \u2014 $149 for the iPhone 7 Plus, or $129 for the iPhone 7 \u2014 on top of the existing cost of buying a new\u00a0iPhone 7 or 7 Plus ($649 or $769 unlocked, respectively.\u00a0By comparison, getting a cracked screen fixed without having AppleCare would\u00a0cost you $149 , so there is some benefit to be had by enrolling.\nHowever, the fun stops when you read the fine print: having an AppleCare+ subscription, which costs $129, includes only two repairs from accidental damage, plus a service fee. After you\u2019ve somehow broken your iPhone 7 twice (thus\u00a0confirming that you\u2019re accident-prone), all repairs will cost $29 thereafter. This updated pricing applies to existing AppleCare+ customers as well.\nAs for the last-generation flagship iPhones (the 6S and 6S Plus), an\u00a0AppleCare+ subscription will be the same pricing\u00a0structure ($149 and $129), with the same policies as iPhone 7 AppleCare+ customers.\nTry not to break your shiny new phone, is my personal recommendation.","date":"2016-09-08T11:32:01","id":1382430,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/its-now-only-29-to-fix-your-cracked-iphone-if-you-have-applecare\/","slug":"its-now-only-29-to-fix-your-cracked-iphone-if-you-have-applecare","tags":[291,43124,106595,120],"title.rendered":"It\u2019s now only $29 to fix your cracked iPhone if you have\u00a0AppleCare+","views":39169},{"index":72,"author":28255590,"categories":[4213,15328,120,20429],"content.rendered":"Managing the App Store can be one of the most difficult experiences for new developers.

And to make things more interesting, there\u2019s a lot of interest in\u00a0different platforms beyond traditional\u00a0apps \u2014 including messaging bots.\nEventually, there will have to be a way to seamlessly develop applications that can thread across multiple platforms like messenger bots and, theoretically, more suped-up web browser experiences. That\u2019s what Ernestine Fu, a part-time\u00a0partner at Alsop Louie partners, is hoping to get done with a new company called Blackstorm.

If you think about whats next, where are we actually going to have new distribution platforms, that can exist in the form of one messenger, apps within app environments, IoT, mobile browsers, the goal of this company is powering the infrastructure to trade and distribute\u00a0software to all the post app-store platforms.\u201d\nThe hope is, while starting with messenger bots and mobile browsers, eventually this kind of development platform and distribution will be able to spread to all sorts of emerging computing platforms like IoT or in-car experiences. Sure, platform shifts\u00a0do happen regularly, but they can be highly unpredictable. There was a moment in time where it seemed likely that Facebook on the web would be the dominant interface for developers \u2014 and it worked for things like games \u2014 but eventually usage shifted almost entirely to mobile.\nNow, it would seem, the race is on for Messenger applications. Case in point, Apple is opening up its iMessage service to third-party developers (as well as a whole lot of other things), and Facebook and Slack are aggressively trying to attract developers to build bots and other services within the platform. A lot of this is playing catch-up to the experience originally created and popularized by WeChat in China, Fu said, and is long overdue.\n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s a new platform that\u2019s created, there\u2019s new problems,\u201d Fu said. \u201cThere\u2019s two in particular that stand out, the first one is it\u2019s hard for developers to embrace new tools and technology. The second aspect in the beginning it\u2019s also very inefficient to distribute to users. And at the end of the life cycle it gets really\u00a0inefficient in that only the Triple-A top tier content with millions in marketing will have a big audience. I think traditionally platform shifts have endured these pains over many years and evolved to have a mutual balance, but now there\u2019s an explosion of computing platforms.\u201d\nRight now, Blackstorm consists of two products: what Fu is calling the Neo Store, and a development environment that can spread across multiple different types of user experiences like messengers. The former is a white-label service for companies like telecom providers to deliver additional content beyond using just an App Store using web portals, Fu said. The latter, for now, includes an IDE, but the aim there is to just make it easy for developers to publish across multiple platforms regardless of the experience.\nBut with the emergence of new platforms comes the race to develop for it, get there first, and stick a flag in it in order to attract early adopters. Of course, silly apps will be there, but developers will eventually create use cases that piggyback and work really well on messengers, and they\u2019ll eventually be starting with just one (probably Facebook, the biggest one). They\u2019re going to need to find ways to branch out to new platforms as they emerge, as well as existing ones, and that\u2019s something that Blackstorm hopes to facilitate.\nIt\u2019s also going to require a shift in user behavior. Normally we interface with a bunch of squares on our screen that we download from the App Store. There\u2019s certainly a lot of drop-off from between someone linking an app through a messenger to downloading the app, and inevitably setting up an account. The square grid on your phone probably isn\u2019t going away \u2014 you can already save web applications to the screen, for example \u2014 but the whole experience of sharing and playing around with apps is likely shifting to suit whatever environment you exist in at the moment you want to interact with it.\nApple has taken a lot of effort to level the playing field for the App Store. It recently began efforts to\u00a0remove\u00a0abandoned apps and fight spammy app names. All this is aimed to make the App Store experience more palatable, but it\u2019s hard to say if that will be successful. Developers are going to follow the audience and a more seamless development experience may end up also attracting early adopters.\nFu thinks that Blackstorm will one day be able to replace the App Store. That\u2019s pretty aggressive and for the foreseeable future, seems really unlikely. But that\u2019s not to say that it can\u2019t co-exist with the App Store for the time being \u2014 and, who knows what the future holds as user behavior shifts. WeChat is a prime example of a ton of usage existing within a different application beyond just an App Store. Other new platforms, like VR and various connected devices, are also still in their infancy and it\u2019s not clear if they will become widely used.","date":"2016-09-08T11:17:07","id":1382401,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/blackstorm-raises-33-5m-to-help-developers-get-their-apps-everywhere-beyond-the-app-store\/","slug":"blackstorm-raises-33-5m-to-help-developers-get-their-apps-everywhere-beyond-the-app-store","tags":[5247686,449553151,449553202,104422],"title.rendered":"Blackstorm raises $33.5M to help developers get their apps everywhere beyond the App\u00a0Store","views":111332},{"index":73,"author":105980861,"categories":[4213,15835174,120,20429,17396],"content.rendered":"Whether you\u2019re working out of a dorm room or running a billion-dollar company, a little pivot can go a long way. At their worst, pivots\u00a0can derail a company\u2019s success, but at their best, they demonstrate a company is still attuned to its\u00a0user base \u2014 no matter how big it\u00a0gets.\nDigit, a fintech service\u00a0that helps people save, launched a year and a half ago with the hypothesis that the key to incentivizing savings was simplicity. The company dropped a nifty SMS tool to proactively inform users of their spending habits and nudge people to save. While it\u2019s true that simplicity is important, it turned out that\u00a0people didn\u2019t feel very in control of their money over a platform as colloquial as text messaging.\nTo address this problem, Digit launched an iOS application that rapidly grew to account for half of all\u00a0users. Today, the company is taking the next step\u00a0by launching an Android version of their service as well.\u00a0As we previously covered, Digit connects to your checking account and analyzes personal cashflow to optimize savings.\nWhen we spoke with Digit CEO\u00a0Ethan Bloch, he said he expects the number of users accessing Digit through their mobile app to grow to 90 percent in the coming months. The premise is an interesting one with a number of fintech services\u00a0taking sides between in-app and out-of-app offerings.\nMobile payments company Boku for example raised $13.75 million in funding last week to facilitate transactions for digital goods and services outside of an application. Users input their mobile phone number to pay for goods directly. People\u00a0are comfortable processing \u201chundreds of millions of transactions\u201d on the platform, but Digit has been discovering that all of that changes when the transaction moves from spending to saving.\nBloch gives an explanation\u00a0rooted in behavioral science to explain why his Digit savings service works better through a mobile application. Bloch noticed that engagement was double in the mobile application. He explained this data point by saying that users want to feel their money is cordoned off and protected.\u00a0Fundamentally there is nothing different in how money is managed on\u00a0an\u00a0SMS service or one run through a mobile app. However, an app provides the illusion of separateness, a private place users can check their balance. And while it may seem silly, small details like this matter in the real world.\nThe shift seems to be working as the company has grown to manage $30 million in savings every month, up from the $20 million we reported back in June. The 19 person company is projecting $360 million per year in facilitated savings.\nInterestingly, the iPhone user demographic is wealthier than that of Android, so the new application will make it easier for everyday Americans to use Digit to manage their cashflow.\n\u201cAndroid gives us a more normal distribution of the working population, and a better sense of the economic fate of the country, including more people who have trouble making ends meet each month,\u201d said\u00a0Bloch\nIn the coming months, Digit will be focusing its financial resources on developing new\u00a0features in their product roadmap. The company has raised over $36 million in funding from GV, General Catalyst, Ribbit Capital, and Baseline.\nThe new app is available from the Google Play store starting today for\u00a0Android 4.1.2 and higher.\u00a0Even with the new app, customers can continue to receive financial updates via SMS if they so choose.","date":"2016-09-08T10:36:24","id":1382376,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/digit-a-simple-app-to-help-you-save-launches-android-app\/","slug":"digit-a-simple-app-to-help-you-save-launches-android-app","tags":[641922,138460,216504,24167,7579],"title.rendered":"Digit, a simple app to help you save, launches Android\u00a0app","views":51902},{"index":74,"author":95776086,"categories":[11160,60523764],"content.rendered":"Online merchants spend a lot of money on chargebacks, which are demands by credit card providers to reimburse for fraudulent charges.

Google, Amazon, Facebook and Uber are near monopolies that provide services as integral to our modern life as power, telephone and transportation systems were a century ago.\nBut there is a key difference between last century\u2019s utilities and today\u2019s: Instead of simply delivering a service, today\u2019s utilities use algorithms to shape our entire life experience. From the news we see and the routes we drive, to the price we pay for goods and services, algorithms influence them all.\nWith algorithms in play, companies can optimize for every variable. Uber efficiently dispatches its drivers during rush hour, Facebook displays the most relevant stories to its users and Amazon can suggest the right product at the optimal time to drive a purchase. For all their positives, what algorithms aren\u2019t optimized for is doing the right thing or for displaying any amount of transparency.\nFrom the outside, there\u2019s no understanding of how decisions are made inside those software-driven black boxes, and no way to know if the companies are overtly or inadvertently behaving badly. The algorithms that manage internal operations strongly favor doing whatever is the most expedient, efficient and effective, even if that means excluding some people from information or services, or leaving the door open to amplifying societal biases.\nThis has to change, and these companies themselves must take the lead in creating algorithmic accountability in their services. This goes beyond pledging to do more to promote fairness in access as Airbnb did earlier this year, and extends to creating a level of automated transparency that would let consumers, the press, the technology community or public officials look in and see what\u2019s going on.\nThe industry shouldn\u2019t rely on government to play this role. Old-school regulations \u2014 the kinds written by lawmakers and bureaucrats \u2014 are too cumbersome to keep up with technology and too \u201cdumb\u201d to monitor algorithms in a timely way. Government-led regulation would burden tech companies and slow innovation. Prime example: 20th-century electric utilities and how regulation stifled investment and innovation for decades.\nThe last thing we need is for companies to become as innovation-starved as the highly regulated electric utilities. At the turn of the last century, regulation brought order to the chaos of competing standards and fly-by-night outfits. But in a short time, regulators dictated a \u201ccost-plus\u201d business model for the industry. For decades this meant the utilities had zero incentive to pursue cleaner, more distributed sources of energy, or to invest in any innovation at all. Regulation fostered a mindset that exacerbated climate change issues, which we\u2019re only now beginning to make progress against.\nSoftware-defined regulation can monitor software-driven industries better than regulations enforced by squads of regulators.\nTo avoid a similar fate, these new utilities (the Googles, Amazons and Ubers of the world) must proactively build algorithmic accountability into their systems, faithfully and transparently act as their own watchdogs or risk eventual onerous regulation.\nConcern about \u201cblack box\u201d algorithms that govern our lives has been spreading. New York University\u2019s Information Law Institute hosted a conference on algorithmic accountability, noting: \u201cScholars, stakeholders, and policymakers question the adequacy of existing mechanisms governing algorithmic decision-making and grapple with new challenges presented by the rise of algorithmic power in terms of transparency, fairness, and equal treatment.\u201d Yale Law School\u2019s Information Society Project is studying this, too. \u201cAlgorithmic modeling may be biased or limited, and the uses of algorithms are still opaque in many critical sectors,\u201d the group concluded.\nSoftware-defined regulation can monitor software-driven industries better than regulations enforced by squads of regulators. Algorithms can watch emerging utilities such as Facebook and Uber 24\/7, seeing details and patterns that humans might never catch. If transportation officials who regulated taxis want make sure Uber doesn\u2019t shun certain neighborhoods or bias its service, they should write an algorithm to look for the behavior.\nIt\u2019s just as important to have algorithms that keep an eye on the role of humans inside these companies. We want technology that can tell if Airbnb hosts are illegally turning down minorities or if Facebook\u2019s human editors are squashing conservative news headlines.\n\nThe watchdog algorithms can be like open-source software \u2014 open to examination by anyone. That way, coders can see if the watchdog algorithms are monitoring the right things, while the companies keep private proprietary algorithms and data.\nThere\u2019s another benefit \u2014 perhaps a huge one \u2014 to software-defined regulation. It will also show us a path to a more efficient government. The world\u2019s legal logic and regulations can be coded into software and smart sensors can offer real-time monitoring of everything from air and water quality, traffic flows and queues at the DMV. Regulators define the rules, technologist create the software to implement them and then AI and ML help refine iterations of policies going forward. This should lead to much more efficient, effective governments at the local, national and global levels.\nStill, we now need a conversation about how to make this work. Technology companies and policymakers need to come together and share ideas \u2014 which is too rare in this software-in-everything era. It\u2019s clear that following this path we are on will result in regulatory schemes governing social networks, search and other key services, making them as dull and bureaucratic as electric companies. And that would turn out badly for the tech industry, the economy and society.","date":"2016-09-08T10:00:08","id":1380593,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/the-need-for-algorithmic-accountability\/","slug":"the-need-for-algorithmic-accountability","tags":[449553099,3378,636],"title.rendered":"The need for algorithmic\u00a0accountability","views":162265},{"index":76,"author":2414667,"categories":[4213,120,17396],"content.rendered":"Pok\u00e9mon Go has achieved\u00a0a number of records since its debut \u2013 the most downloaded app in its first week ever\u00a0and\u00a0the fastest to reach 50 million installs on Google Play, for example \u2013 but now you can add one more to the list: the fastest game to reach $500 million in revenue. According to a new report from App Annie, Pok\u00e9mon Go has now surpassed $500 million in worldwide customer spending across iOS and Android, and is on track to hit a billion in revenue by year-end.\nThe game reached the new milestone in just over 60 days, App Annie says.\n\nThe news follows Niantic Labs\u2019 announcement at yesterday\u2019s Apple iPhone 7 event that the game had been downloaded over 500 million times worldwide since its debut, and trainers had walked over 4.6 billion kilometers while playing.

Candy Crush Saga took over 200 days and Clash of Clans and Puzzle & Dragons took over 400 days to rake in that much money.\nThe report also pointed out that in-app revenue alone is not Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s only source of income The company is beginning to partner with brands for in-app exposure, too.

In iOS 10, which is arriving on September 13, iMessage will offer rich link previews \u2013 meaning inline previews of the web links you\u2019re texting to a friend.\nSurprisingly, Twitter had not yet supported this in DMs \u2013 despite the fact that it allows for rich media\u00a0in its main Twitter timeline.\nThe DM product, in fact, hadn\u2019t seen much attention over the years until Twitter finally made the decision last summer to drop the 140 character limit from private messaging.

That led to the pivot to Yala instead \u2013 something that addressed a problem Levitt faced himself while building Pinecone.\n\u201cI was dissatisfied with Buffer, and its less impressive competitors, because multi-channel posting took time,\u201d explains Levitt, \u201cespecially when it came to scheduling across many channels, editing, choosing times and composing,\u201d he says.\nBuffer, by way of background, is a social media scheduling service, which also offers tools that help you determine the best time to publish.\nHowever, with Yala, the idea is to bring a similar sort of intelligence a bit \u201ccloser to home,\u201d says Levitt \u2013 meaning, Slack.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382286-2 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382286-2 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382286-2 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382286-2 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nTo determine the best time to post, Yala looks at your social media posting history to determine which times and posts led to the most shares, likes and clicks. It also takes into account things like time zones and other audience behaviors. Plus, the machine learning aspect enables it to improve and automatically correct itself on the fly, given your own social media engagement metrics.\nBy being able to identify patterns, it\u2019s able to create a posting schedule that refines itself in real-time, Levitt says.\nThe team\u00a0saw\u00a0a 10 percent increase in shares and posts when they used Yala, during testing. (Yala, in case you\u2019re curious, is a slang term in Israel, borrowed from Arabic, which means \u201cget a move on.\u201d)\nCurrently, the bot works with Facebook and Twitter, and is live on Slack. Additional platforms and social networks are in development now.\nYala is a bootstrapped team of three, and is based in both New York and Israel.","date":"2016-09-08T09:07:23","id":1382286,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/yalas-new-chatbot-knows-the-best-time-to-post-to-social-networks\/","slug":"yalas-new-chatbot-knows-the-best-time-to-post-to-social-networks","tags":[175,49818],"title.rendered":"Yala\u2019s new chatbot knows the best time to post to social\u00a0networks","views":22487},{"index":81,"author":89192944,"categories":[17396,34942364],"content.rendered":"In what is certainly the first of many pieces of VR original content to receive a prestigious award, \u201cHenry,\u201d a short film by Oculus, has just received an Emmy for\u00a0Outstanding Original Interactive Program.\nThe virtual reality film chronicles the story of Henry, a cute little hedgehog that loves to hug despite his prickly spines.\u00a0Things turn interesting rather quickly when he has a birthday party with a bunch of balloon animals as guests\u2026\nThe short film is\u00a0narrated by Elijah Wood, and is\u00a0directed by Ramiro Lopez Dau, an ex-Pixar animator who worked on projects like\u00a0\u201cBrave\u201d and \u201cCars 2.\u201d\n\nThe short film came out of Oculus Story Studios, a division of the company flush with talented filmmakers and animators tasked with reimagining storytelling for the medium of virtual reality.\nOculus is generally heralded\u00a0as a virtual reality gaming company more than anything and the company\u00a0generally seems\u00a0a bit more reticent than others (at least their current primary competitor HTC) space\u00a0at highlighting the\u00a0non-gaming content available on their platform. \u201cHenry\u201d is a perfect example of some of the brilliance coming out of Oculus Story Studio, a group that is really trying to explore some of the more base elements of VR storytelling.

The employee review and job-search platform has acquired Love Mondays, a startup based out of Sao Paulo that also lets workers post reviews of their workplaces. It\u2019s even\u00a0been described as \u201cthe Glassdoor of Latin America\u201d by its co-founder and CEO, Luciana Caletti.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at Brazil for a while, the fifth largest country by population and the largest in Latin America in terms of its economy,\u201d\u00a0Robert Hohman, co-founder and CEO of Glassdoor, said in an interview. \u201cWe had been turning our attention to South America and I had\u00a0been talking to  Luciana\u00a0for years, and so a deal made sense to accelerate.\u201d\u00a0This is a tech, employee and existing business acquisition, he added.\nFinancial terms of the deal are not being disclosed. Love Mondays, which was founded in 2014 and has 20 employees, had raised around $2 million in funding with investors including Kaszek Ventures.\nLove Mondays also participated earlier this summer in Google\u2019s\u00a0Launchpad accelerator program aimed at startups from Brazil, India and Indonesia. That came with an equity-free $50,000, but Glassdoor tells me that Love Mondays declined because the startup was\u00a0already in talks with Glassdoor. (Does this make Love Mondays the first exit from Google\u2019s\u00a0accelerator? I\u2019ll ask.)\nThe acquisition\u00a0is only the second that Glassdoor has made in its history, its first in seven years, and its first acquisition outside of the U.S.\nIts first was in 2009, of a company called JobVent, which\u00a0let workers\u00a0post anonymous reviews of their employers. JobVent\u00a0was\u00a0renamed\u00a0Jobitorial\u00a0by Glassdoor, and eventually\u00a0its database and tech were integrated\u00a0completely into Glassdoor itself. It\u2019s something of an early move in Twitter commerce: JobVent\u2019s\u00a0founder, who had moved on somewhere else, offered his site in a Tweet and someone at Glassdoor followed up, Hohman told\u00a0me.\nSimilar to JobVent, Love Mondays plans to keep its brand \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d. While that will help Glassdoor (and Love Mondays)\u00a0continue building a local business under its existing brand, it will also give Glassdoor a bigger selection of regions (and languages) that it can market to larger multinationals that want to hire more people specifically in Brazil.\n\u201cLove Mondays is excited to join forces with Glassdoor to help connect national and multinational companies with top notch Brazilian talent,\u201d said Luciana Caletti, CEO of Love Mondays, who co-founded the company with David Curran (who is also her husband) and Shane O\u2019Grady. \u201cGlassdoor\u2019s reputation and management team make the company an ideal partner to help take Love Mondays to the next level. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about our future prospects together.\u201d\nWhile Love Mondays was growing nicely and Caletti told me that it had some solid plans to expand across all of Latin America (which seems to dovetail with Glassdoor\u2019s ambitions too), right now is a time of consolidation in the online career space. Simply Hired has been acquired by Recruit Holdings (owner of Indeed); Monster has been snapped up by Holland\u2019s Randstad; and biggest of all, LinkedIn \u2014 a major platform for recruitment in the professional sector \u2014 is being bought by Microsoft for $26.2 billion.\nThat\u2019s before you consider the plethora of smaller acquisitions that have taken place. In that context, it\u2019s no surprise that Love Mondays would get bought, and Glassdoor would do the buying of a clone, to scale up.\n\u201cThese businesses\u00a0work better at scale, that is the bottom line,\u201d Hohman told me. He would not comment on whether Glassdoor will be doing more of the consolidating.\nPrior to the acquisition, Glassdoor\u2019s footprint extended into providing localised experiences 11 markets and six languages: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, France, India, Ireland, Holland, Austria, Switzerland, the U.S. and the U.K. \u00a0But interestingly, the viral growth of the site has meant that it actually had managed to collect employee feedback in across 190 countries.\nLove Mondays will\u00a0give the company a more formal window into growing across Portuguese-speaking countries, and specifically to pick up a business that is already up and running in Brazil, Latin America\u2019s biggest market; as well as potentially expanding into other countries in the region (and languages \u2014 Spanish being the more popular of the two across Latin America).\nLove Mondays\u00a0already provides reviews and listings for some 75,000 employers in Brazil, Glassdoor says. As a point of context, Glassdoor currently lists reviews and jobs for around 580,000\u00a0businesses in its database, and it makes money when those companies pay to have better access to update and tweak their profiles. When the company announced its funding in June this year, CEO and co-founder Robert Hohman told me that some\u00a04,000 companies globally are paying for that premium service.\nUpdated with clarification about Launchpad.","date":"2016-09-08T09:00:36","id":1382070,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/glassdoor-acquires-brazils-love-mondays-to-expand-into-latin-america\/","slug":"glassdoor-acquires-brazils-love-mondays-to-expand-into-latin-america","tags":[5786856,43571437],"title.rendered":"Glassdoor acquires Brazil\u2019s Love Mondays to expand into Latin\u00a0America","views":224953},{"index":83,"author":39990176,"categories":[120,17396],"content.rendered":"Well goodbye then, iPhone first weekend sales\u00a0metric. You had a good innings, as the British like to say, but the days of Cupertino\u00a0putting a figure on how many iPhones it has managed to flog in the first few days of sales are done. Let\u2019s say\u00a0they\u2019re (Tim) Cooked.\nApple announced\u00a0the forthcoming\u00a0iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus yesterday, revealing two new iPhones\u00a0without a\u00a03.5mm headphone jack but with\u00a0some light new\u00a0design elements, as well as water and dust resistance; beefed up storage and battery life; a dual-lens rear camera; a reworked home button; stereo speakers; and the customary CPU\u00a0upgrade.\nPre-orders for the two new iPhones start on Friday, with\u00a0store availability from\u00a0September 16. But, unlike in previous new\u00a0iPhone release cycles, come Monday Apple won\u2019t be saying how many handsets it\u2019s shifted.\nThe company\u00a0tells Reuters\u00a0it is ending the traditional first weekend glimpse of\u00a0iPhone sales because there is no point in releasing a figure that merely\u00a0measures its (in)ability to fulfill demand.\u00a0Although\u00a0of course it\u00a0would say that.\nAn Apple spokeswoman\u00a0told the news agency: \u201cAs we have expanded our distribution through carriers and resellers to hundreds of thousands of locations around the world, we are now at a point where we know before taking the first customer pre-order that we will sell out of iPhone 7. These initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand, and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers.\u201d\nNow there are two schools of thought here \u2014 one of which is that Apple is explicitly promising a \u201csell out\u201d and thus the iPhone 7 is a sewn-up, in-the-bag home run. And,\u00a0in a perfect world where Apple\u2019s\u00a0supply chain had limitless on-demand\u00a0capacity, it\u00a0could shift more iPhones than it can in\u00a0the real world, where even Cook\u2019s supply chain expertise can only stretch manufacturing capacity so far. So why should Apple\u00a0report a smaller number of iPhone sales than demand for new\u00a0iPhones\u00a0exists?\nThe other school of thought is that Apple is cloaking traditional first weekend iPhone sales because it\u2019s rather less confident about\u00a0its controversial decision to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack than\u00a0Phil Schiller made out on stage yesterday. So less #Courage, more #Contingency.\nThe new iPhones also don\u2019t represent a big design overhaul\u00a0over last year\u2019s models (or indeed the year before) \u2014 which might also discourage iOS users from upgrading.\u00a0In saturated smartphone markets skipping an\u00a0upgrade cycle or two might not seem such a big deal when this year\u2019s iPhones look much the same as\u00a02014\u2019s models.\nAdd to that\u00a0Cupertino of course remains\u00a0massively scrutinized so any perceived blip in early iPhone 7 sales figures could\u00a0rebound painfully on its bottom line.\u00a0So \u2014 eyeing\u00a0shareholder value \u2014 why take the risk of revealing sales figures when you don\u2019t have to?\u00a0Just\u00a0be sure to get that message out early, i.e. ahead of pre-orders, rather than once orders have started flowing and\/or\u00a0the world\u2019s media is expecting you to drop an impressive set of digits.\n#Control.\nWhich just leaves the sales guesstimates\u2026\nSpeculating on Apple\u2019s decision not to release first weekend sales for the iPhone 7, analyst Ben Bajarin tweets that he\u2019s expecting \u201croughly flat\u201d sales figures \u2014 in the region of 10 million units\u2026\n\n\nMeaning opening weekend numbers will roughly flat so ~10m units.

First, there\u2019s a personalized greeting appearing atop News Feeds of users who\u2019ve liked or otherwise interacted with Star Trek or sci-fi content on FB, and there\u2019s also a special custom profile frame you can apply to your primary display pic. Finally, and perhaps more importantly, there are redesigned reaction emoji inspired by key characters form the series.\nMessenger marketing lead Lindsey Shephard shared Facebook\u2019s various celebrations in a Medium post today, including a gallery (which you can see below) of the step-by-step process FB\u2019s creative team went through in order to produce the stunning papercraft USS Enterprise they used to create their customized creating artwork.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382196-3 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382196-3 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382196-3 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382196-3 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe best part really though are the new reactions, which include custom version of the Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry reaction options Facebook users can employ to quickly respond to posts.

It promises to revolutionize how we work, shop, socialize, date, bank, heal, navigate\u2026 how we live.\nYet here I am in the engine room of the revolution, getting increasingly frustrated with the prevalent AI conversations and memes. We\u2019re painting a partial, bipolar, even misleading picture. \u201cWe\u201d sometimes includes me, and it includes journalists, pundits, analysts and even practitioners.\nWhat do I mean? Specifically, we highlight the highs (AlphaGo beats world champion!) and lambast the lows (Chatbot Tay turns racist and hateful!), while brushing off smaller (but meaningful) advances. We keep giving air time to robot-takeover fears, while failing to evangelize and thus guide the real value of AI\u00a0today.\nAs humans, we\u2019re drawn to the dramatic, but as an industry, we have a responsibility to get everyone on the same, grounded-in-reality page. So forgive me for sharpening my proverbial axe. Here are three specific AI topics that need a reboot.\nPervasive if mundane\nWe are all rightly in awe of the splashy, sexy and sometimes scary AI concepts we read about in the headlines. The end of apps, the end of screens, autonomous vehicles, autonomous weapon systems\u2026 Though not difficult to imagine, many of these scenarios are several years out. But less sensational AI models are already here, now, improving our everyday experiences. They\u2019re great. And we should talk about them more.\nA broad array of companies are quietly innovating on top of AI technologies \u2014 and integrating the resulting innovations into services today. Their models are showing us the right products (e.g. Expedia, Getty Images), serving smarter ads (e.g. GumGum, Pinterest), organizing our content (e.g. GoPro, Microsoft), guiding investments (e.g. Sentient), talking to us in the words we understand (e.g. DoCoMo, IBM Watson) and more. Each of these is one of our customers, and each of them is filled with smart people working hard to improve their products using AI. Many of them work on agile software teams. Over time, their incremental progress will revolutionize technology. But don\u2019t expect to wake up tomorrow as Bruce Willis in \u201cSurrogates.\u201d\nNot just for the big platforms anymore\nIn this AI Spring, we\u2019re seeing big news almost daily, much of it brought to us by the tech behemoths we all know and love. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, Apple and others are constantly making waves with new AI projects and developments. And these companies are paying big money for AI startups (recent examples include Turi and Nervana). It\u2019s war.\nIt\u2019s not just who has the models, it\u2019s about who applies the right data.\nBut AIs are not just for the big guys. Why? Three reasons. First, the affordability of massive computing power. Indeed, the commoditization of compute power is a large part of why the big cloud platforms want you developing models on top of Azure, AWS, Watson and GCP, and why Intel and NVIDIA want you doing it on their silicon. Second, there are more ML- and AI-trained engineers than ever before, taking advantage of decades of science advancing the underlying algorithms.\nThird, largely behind the scenes, product teams from startups to retailers and systems integrators are applying others\u2019 AI platforms using their own proprietary training data. The most sophisticated algorithms are only able to see, listen, talk and \u201cthink\u201d like humans if the right humans are training and re-training them as our fickle human opinions evolve. Nobody understands shoes like Shoes.com, surfing videos like GoPro, top-shelf stock imagery like Getty \u2014 and their customers.\nSometimes the ability to leverage cognitive computing is less about the underlying algorithms and more about how they are tuned and productized. Mark my words: It\u2019s not just who has the models, it\u2019s about who applies the right data.\nA means, not an end\nLastly, can we please stop evaluating AIs based on whether they are saving us from cancer or threatening humanity? These questions bait valuable conversations, but miss the bigger, more important \u201cmiddle.\u201d I love telling my mom that we train AIs. But AIs are not the goal.\u00a0When we all go to that tech-loving part of our brain, we forget that AIs are the means to improved experiences.\n\nWe all accept that a picture is \u201cworth a thousand words.\u201d We also know that most of our communication is non-verbal (just contrast your last date, or in-person interview, with your last telecon call). So how much are 100 million images worth? How about terabytes of CT scans of your loved one\u2019s brain tumor? And what about 24 hours of video, at 30 fps? Well, of course, that depends on what\u2019s in the data \u2014 and, more importantly, what we can do with it.\nAIs hold the key to unlocking the value buried in the massive, exponentially growing sets of unstructured content with which we each interact daily.\nAs such, I humbly propose that we measure the value of an AI based on its ability to contribute positive utility to people. We all know that at the end of the day, it\u2019s the people who matter in our lives. Just the same, we need to remember that AIs should be measured by their ability to understand, interact with and improve people\u2019s lives. This utilitarian framework offers hundreds of years of insights from philosophers, economists and anthropologists.\nThe new nukes\nAIs are pervasive, and are creating the power to spread good and bad. Time and time again, people have managed to guide innovations for the good of humanity. In some ways, AIs remind me of nuclear technologies. Handled poorly, they could destroy the world. But they haven\u2019t. In fact, we have avoided another world war thanks in part to mutual assured destruction, and atomic know-how has quietly revolutionized healthcare, energy, robotics, physics and aerospace.\nYes, the extremes are scary, but they are only part of the story. If we are to harness AIs for universal good, we need to be more realistic about their daily implications and the net benefits thereof. Less \u201cduck and cover\u201d and more comprehensive conversation.","date":"2016-09-08T08:00:11","id":1380133,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/setting-the-ai-record-straight-for-now\/","slug":"setting-the-ai-record-straight-for-now","tags":[491855,46390395],"title.rendered":"Setting the AI record straight (for\u00a0now)","views":219331},{"index":87,"author":2414667,"categories":[329026,17396],"content.rendered":"Dish Network\u2019s\u00a0streaming service for cord cutters, Sling TV, has made its way to Windows 10.

While Sling TV\u2019s\u00a0legacy PC software will continue to be supported, the new Windows 10 application has been designed to take advantage of features unique to that operating system.\nThis includes support for touch, a vertical main menu on Sling TV, and Windows\u2019 Live Tiles, which will now show \u201cFavorites\u201d and \u201cContinue Watching\u201d ribbons when Sling TV is pinned to the Start Menu.\nThe new, responsive app can also adapt to different screen sizes and can be snapped to use only half the screen. And it works with Cortana, Windows 10\u2019s built-in assistant.\u00a0That means you can search for specific shows or channels by voice.\nAs with any Sling TV subscription, new customers can sign up for over-the-top streaming TV starting at $20 per month. This includes access to a number of top TV channels, like ESPN, Disney, AMC, Comedy Central, HGTV, TNT, TBS, FOX\u00a0and NBC (in select markets), A&E, VICELAND and CNN.\nSubscribers\u00a0can then choose to customize their channel lineup further by selecting various add-on packs for $5\/month.

Premium channels like HBO, Cinemax, and now, Starz, are also available.\nIn fact, Starz and Starz Encore were just added today, and the pack is being offered for free until September 14th as a promotion. It\u2019s then $9 per month to include it in your Sling TV subscription, either Sling TV Blue or Sling TV Orange. (The colors refer to different tiers \u2013 Blue\u00a0lets you stream on multiple devices at the same time, and has an expanded channel lineup.)

But until now, the\u00a0shortest thing you could typically listen to was a three minute song, especially when you factor in the time to get your headphones untangled, on, and playing. Hearing anything shorter was more trouble than it was worth.\nYet with wireless earbuds going mainstream thanks to the unveiling of Apple\u2019s AirPods, we\u2019re poised to see an explosion of shorter audio content consumption and creation.\n\nFirst, it will become much easier to consume short snippets of audio during the in-between moments of life, similar to how we consume visual content today. Waiting in line at the coffee shop, during pauses between public interactions, or whenever we have a spare couple seconds, many of us reach for our phones. We pop open our favorite apps like Twitter or Imgur, and relax with a few scrolls or swipes.\nWireless earbuds unlock this behavior for audio. Without the wires getting in the way, we\u2019ll be more likely to leave them in our ears so they\u2019re at the ready. We could listen to a page or even just a few lines of an audio book or make a little progress on a podcast\u00a0whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nLonger-term, wireless earbuds that we still take out could be the bridge towards an (essentially) always-in audio technology. With that future in mind, I believe we\u2019ll see shorter-form audio content start to be purposefully created.\nFive-minute YouTube clips seemed brief when they first emerged on desktop, but soon enough, mobile gave rise to six-second clips on Vine and social videos optimized for Facebook that catch your eye in the first three seconds as you scroll by. Perhaps AirPods and their contemporaries will usher in a similar shift in audio creation.\nImagine stand-up comedians boiling routines down to snackable one-liners, or playlists that sequence the best short jokes to fill your wireless buds. Apps designed to read you summaries of news articles would grow more ubiquitous. Authors might divide their works into shorter chapters. We could see more mini-songs like the twenty three-second Beatles track \u201cHer Majesty\u201d. \u00a0And asynchronous voice clip messaging might replace some our daily texting.\nDown the line, simpler interaction with Siri and other apps through voice commands could emerge as the core value of AirPods. Right now, voice recognition is still a bit spotty. As it improves and we grow to rely on voice interfaces, more interactive short-form audio content could take off. If there\u2019s one company I\u2019d trust to build a device that essentially lives in my ear all the time, it\u2019s Apple.\n\nUntil we all shift to wireless, Apple ditching the iPhone\u2019s headphone jack may actually make quick audio consumption tougher for some people as they fiddle with Lightning connector dongles for their old headphones. But once we ditch the cords, we can look forward to a new generation of snappy sonic entertainment whispering in our ears.","date":"2016-09-08T07:47:06","id":1381797,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/snackable-audio\/","slug":"snackable-audio","tags":[],"title.rendered":"AirPods and the rise of snackable\u00a0audio","views":346495},{"index":89,"author":5302483,"categories":[1559,17396],"content.rendered":"The speaker that speaks might soon speak without you speaking to ask it to speak. Amazon\u2019s Echo is set to get push notifications, according to The Information, which would allow it to give you a heads up about activity from its connected services, so it could, for example, tell you when your connected doorbell rings or pipe up and tell you when a loved one\u2019s flight has landed.\nCurrently, Echo only speaks when spoken to; a user has to use the activation word \u201cAlexa\u201d to prompt it to begin listening for a command or request, and then it\u2019ll respond to said input with its own vocal response. Alexa hasn\u2019t supported the ability to provide any kind of audio notice unprompted as a result of data it receives from a user\u2019s connected services \u2013 the closest it comes is being able to sound an alert based on an alarm or timer.\nEcho has both audio and visual capabilities, thanks to a light ring that surrounds its upper edge, and The Information suggests Amazon could allow developers access to both for push notifications, so that users can choose how much of an intrusion said notices provide.\nAlexa is also a service that exists unbound from the Echo hardware itself, and it\u2019s very possible than any push notification support would extend to other hardware that uses the Alexa API, including the Nucleus smart intercom. The Information says the use of push notices would be part of a larger plan to give developers more control of third-party apps and gadgets overall via Echo and Alexa.\nNotifications will be a tricky thing to get right on Echo, since a push alert with voice in a device with no display is a very different thing from a subtle vibration or screen-based alert on a smartphone. Still, it\u2019s a feature that could do very well provided the user has total and intuitive control over when they\u2019re alerted, and how.","date":"2016-09-08T07:30:42","id":1382169,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/amazon-echo-could-soon-start-talking-to-you-unprompted\/","slug":"amazon-echo-could-soon-start-talking-to-you-unprompted","tags":[6602,295600149],"title.rendered":"Amazon Echo could soon start talking to you\u00a0unprompted","views":19095},{"index":90,"author":39990176,"categories":[4328,17396],"content.rendered":"Europe\u2019s\u00a0top court has ruled that knowingly posting links to copyrighted material can be an infringement of rights holders\u2019 rights \u2014 even though the copyrighted\u00a0material in question is being hosted elsewhere. People\u00a0posting links in a for-profit scenario also have an obligation to have checked they are not infringing copyright, in the court\u2019s view.\nThe ruling pertains to a specific case involving a Dutch news website,\u00a0GeenStijl, which repeatedly\u00a0posted links to Playboy photos of a local TV presenter.\u00a0The photos at the centre of this dispute were being hosted on various other websites without the consent of the rights holder, and\u00a0GeenStijl had apparently\u00a0ignored requests by the rights holder\u00a0to stop linking to the copyrighted material. Although the case\u00a0dates back to 2011, an appeals court in the Netherlands sought a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on the hyperlinks copyright point and that\u2019s now been issued today.\nWhile the CJEU ruling\u00a0notes the importance of the flow of information between individuals online for fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and expression, it also emphasizes\u00a0the need to maintain what it dubs a \u201cfair balance\u201d between the interests of rights holders and the fundamental rights of users of protected objects.\u00a0It\u2019s that \u2018balance\u2019\u00a0the\u00a0ruling seeks\u00a0to achieve\u00a0by creating a distinction between knowingly posting a link to copyrighted material vs doing so unaware and with no intention of seeking financial gain.\nIn its announcement of the ruling, the CJEU writes (emphasis mine):\n\u2026the Court holds that, for the purposes of the individualised assessment of the existence of a \u2018communication to the public\u2019, it is necessary, when the posting of a hyperlink to a work freely available on another website is carried out by a person who, in so doing, does not pursue a profit, to take account of the fact that that person does not know and cannot reasonably know that that work had been published on the internet without the consent of the copyright holder. Indeed, such a person, does not, as a general rule, intervene in full knowledge of the consequences of his conduct in order to give customers access to a work illegally posted on the internet.\nIn contrast, where it is established that such a person knew or ought to have known that the hyperlink he posted provides access to a work illegally published, for example owing to the fact that he was notified thereof by the copyright holders, the provision of that link constitutes a \u2018communication to the public\u2019. The same applies if that link allows users to circumvent the restrictive measures taken by the site where the protected work is posted in order to restrict the public\u2019s access to its own subscribers.\nFurthermore, when hyperlinks are posted for profit, it may be expected that the person who posted such a link should carry out the checks necessary to ensure that the work concerned is not illegally published. Therefore, it must be presumed that that posting has been done with the full knowledge of the protected nature of the work and of the possible lack of the copyright holder\u2019s consent to publication on the internet. In such circumstances, and in so far as that presumption is not rebutted, the act of posting a clickable link to a work illegally published on the internet constitutes a \u2018communication to the public\u2019\nAs Fortune notes, the ruling is unusual in that it\u00a0goes against the\u00a0earlier opinion of the court\u2019s advocate-general\u00a0who back in April recommended that links to copyrighted material\u00a0should not be considered a copyright breach themselves. AG opinions are usually highly influential on the CJEU \u2014 but in this instance the court has sought\u00a0a third way, ruling\u00a0that linking when unaware of copyright infringement and in a not-for-profit context is fine but adding a set of exceptions\u00a0where a hyperlink\u00a0could\u00a0be considered\u00a0a copyright breach in and of itself. It\u2019s a ruling that threatens to complicate how copyright operates online\u00a0in Europe by adding another lay of complexity.\nMost obviously the ruling\u00a0could have substantial implications for search engine Google, whose core business involves\u00a0hyperlinking to content hosted elsewhere. (In Europe the search engine\u00a0has a more than 90 per cent share of the search engine market.) But the impact\u00a0could potentially stretch to any for-profit online publisher which\u00a0hyperlinks to others\u2019 content.\u00a0Although it remains to be seen how broadly courts in EU Member State interpret the notion of posting a link for financial gain.\nGoogle publishes a Transparency Report\u00a0providing an ongoing tally\u00a0of\u00a0search result links that it has removed at the request of rights holders. This shows that in the past year it\u00a0removed 832 million links to content on 342,000 websites. And while that\u2019s already a very large number, all those instances involve Google responding to a takedown notice from a rights holder. By contrast the CJEU ruling appears to imply that for-profit entities such as Google might\u00a0have a pre-emptive responsibility to check\u00a0the legality of the content they are linking to before serving a hyperlink to a user\u00a0\u2014 rather than waiting to receive a takedown notice. Which would be a huge shift.\nOn the flip-side the ruling suggests that individuals who post links to pirated content online without knowing\u00a0the content they are linking to is copyrighted and without doing so for their own financial gain would not be infringing copyright \u2014 with the court noting \u201cit may prove difficult, in particular for individuals who wish to post such links, to ascertain whether the works involved are protected and, if necessary, whether the copyright holders of those works have consented to their publication on the internet\u201d.\nAs it happens, the EU is also in the midst of reworking\u00a0the region\u2019s\u00a0copyright law \u2014 with\u00a0a\u00a0proposed reform package due to be published later this month, on September 21.\nLate last month a leaked version of the EC\u2019s copyright reform document suggested\u00a0the Commission\u00a0is planning to extend\u00a0copyright protections to publishers \u2014 taking\u00a0a similar\u00a0approach to the\u00a0German government which, back in 2014, backed a\u00a0so-called ancillary copyright law designed to cover the news snippets displayed in Google News. A similar law was enacted in Spain \u2014 without a publisher opt-out and\u00a0with a mandatory\u00a0fee\u00a0for displaying publisher snippets \u2014 leading to Mountain View\u00a0to pull the plug on its Google News service in Spain.\nIt remains to be seen how or whether the CJEU hyperlink copyright ruling impacts Google\u2019s business \u2014 as well as how or whether any EU-wide expansion of ancillary copyright for publishers might\u00a0play out. We\u2019ve reached out to Google for comment and will update this post with any response.\nExpressing concerns\u00a0about the EC\u2019s\u00a0copyright reform process late last month, Mozilla\u2019s chief innovation officer Katharina Borchert described the hyperlink as\u00a0\u201cthe basis of the open Internet\u201d.\u00a0The organization is\u00a0actively campaigning for EU copyright law to better\u00a0reflect the reality of how web users share content online.\nDiscussing concerns that the Commission\u00a0intends to\u00a0support the expansion of copyright\u00a0for publishers last month, Borchert\u00a0also\u00a0touched on some of the key\u00a0concerns that are likely to follow today\u2019s\u00a0CJEU ruling, telling TechCrunch:\u00a0\u201cThe question is what are the obligations of content platforms and how much do you really force them to check everything before it is finally uploaded?

In order to combat that, Airbnb is making several positive changes to the platform and its company policies, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky sent in an email to hosts and guests this morning.\nThis includes\u00a0guaranteeing short-term bookings for people who have been discriminated against, deemphasizing the use of user photos, blocking out availability if a host claims a space is taken when it really isn\u2019t and working to increase the number of Instant Book listings, which don\u2019t require hosts to approve specific guests, to one million by the beginning of 2017.\n\u201cDiscrimination is the opposite of belonging, and its existence on our platform jeopardizes this core mission,\u201d Chesky wrote. \u201cBias and discrimination have no place on Airbnb, and we have zero tolerance for them. Unfortunately, we have been slow to address these problems, and for this I am sorry. I take responsibility for any pain or frustration this has caused members of our community. We will not only make this right; we will work to set an example that other companies can follow.\u201d\nAirbnb\u2019s issues with racism date back to at least late last year, when a Harvard study showed that renters with black-sounding names\u00a0were less likely to receive a booking through the site. Then, in June, an Airbnb host in North Carolina canceled a booking on a black person and sent her a slew of racist insults. Shortly after that incident,\u00a0Chesky said that racism is not allowed on the platform\u00a0and Airbnb\u00a0permanently banned the host.\nLater that month, the Congressional Black Caucus urged Airbnb to take further action in addressing the issues of racism and discrimination on the company\u2019s platform, citing how\u00a0Title II of 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in places like hotels and motels on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin.\nToday, Laura Murphy, former head of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Washington D.C. office, laid out Airbnb\u2019s game plan for tackling instances of racism and discrimination on the platform. Airbnb has been working with Murphy since June to ensure that the company is doing everything it can to\u00a0fight racism.\nProduct and policy changes to eradicate racist behavior\nIn the 32-page document, Murphy details Airbnb\u2019s commitment and plan to implement product and policy changes across\u00a0eight\u00a0areas.\nFor one, starting Nov. 1, 2016, anyone who uses Airbnb will have to agree to a community commitment that entails treating fellow members with respect and without judgment and bias.\u00a0Airbnb\u2019s new non-discrimination policy, developed under the guidance of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who joined Airbnb in July, prohibits content that promotes things like racism and bigotry.\n\nAs part of the community commitment, Airbnb will build and release a feature by the first half of next year to\u00a0address the instances of someone requesting a booking that was listed as vacant but then getting informed that it wasn\u2019t available.\u00a0Here\u2019s a nugget from the report:\nIn some cases, it appears that these listings were then made available for\u00a0the same trip to guests of a different race. Going forward, Airbnb will develop a\u00a0feature to help prevent this from happening. If a host rejects a guest by stating that\u00a0their space is not available, Airbnb will automatically block the calendar for\u00a0subsequent reservation requests for that same trip.\nAirbnb has also formed a team of\u00a0engineers, data scientists, researchers and designers whose full-time jobs are to promote diversity and eradicate racism and bias from the Airbnb platform. One of the team\u2019s first tasks will be experimenting with \u201creducing the prominence of guest photos in the booking process and enhancing other parts of host and guests profiles with objective information.\u201d\nIn the event that someone is discriminated against, Airbnb is committed to ensuring that the person finds a place to stay, even if it\u2019s not\u00a0on Airbnb. For anyone who reported discrimination prior to today, Chesky said that Airbnb will help them book their next trip.\nOther changes include the addition of\u00a0new flagging tools so that people can quickly report discrimination or hate speech. That tool will be expanded and enhanced by January 2017.\u00a0Airbnb will also offer unconscious bias training for hosts. Once hosts complete the training, Airbnb will highlight them\u00a0on the platform.\n\u201cThese changes are merely a first step,\u201d Murphy wrote in the report. \u201cAirbnb understands that no one company can\u00a0eliminate racism and discrimination. Fighting bias is an ongoing task that requires constant\u00a0vigilance from all of us. And there is no question that we will continue to see examples of\u00a0bias and discrimination in society, the sharing economy, and Airbnb in the future. As certain\u00a0product tools are built and implemented, they will need to be refined and updated. The task\u00a0of fighting discrimination is difficult, but Airbnb is committed to continuing this work in the\u00a0future, and I will personally hold them to their word. We all should.\u201d\nThe changes were developed in partnership with racial justice group Color of Change, Rainbow\/PUSH Coalition, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP and others.\nDiversity at Airbnb\nCompanywide, Airbnb is 46.3 percent female, 63 percent white, 7.1 percent Latino\/a and 2.9 percent black in the U.S., according to its 2015\u00a0diversity report. Today,\u00a0Airbnb has set a goal to increase the percentage of employees from underrepresented groups\u00a0from 9.64% to 11% by the end of 2017.\nIn order to try to achieve that,\u00a0Airbnb says it will focus more of its recruiting efforts on people from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as from colleges with large Latino populations.\u00a0Airbnb will also bring on a manager for supplier diversity and encourage more underrepresented minorities to list spaces on Airbnb.\nMost importantly, Airbnb will implement a diversity rule to mandate that all senior-level positions include female applicants and applicants from underrepresented backgrounds.\n\u201cAirbnb\u2019s stated commitment to considering diverse candidates for its own senior level positions should be considered by other Silicon Valley companies that have largely failed to reflect the diversity of the nation in their workforces,\u201d\u00a0Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in a statement. \u201cThis report has not addressed every issue of concern but it is an important step in the right direction.\u201d","date":"2016-09-08T07:00:48","id":1381799,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/airbnb-plan-fix-racism-discrimination\/","slug":"airbnb-plan-fix-racism-discrimination","tags":[19239773,13443],"title.rendered":"Here\u2019s Airbnb\u2019s plan to fix its racism and discrimination\u00a0problem","views":459087},{"index":92,"author":55545967,"categories":[4213,449549573,17396],"content.rendered":"The 2016 National Football League season is set to kick off tonight.

Uber customers in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand, will now be able to access their Pandora account from the Uber app in order to listen to their own favorite stations and artists while in the vehicle. The ride-hailing company had announced a similar deal with Spotify back in 2014.\nAnd this\u00a0June, Uber teamed up with Pandora to bring the music service to the drivers\u2019 application, allowing them to stream music, create stations, thumbs up and down songs, and discover new artists, directly from their own Uber app.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that with both Uber drivers and riders now able to stream from Pandora, you have a situation where musical conflicts \u2013 and radio stations takeovers \u2013 can occur. That is, Uber riders can launch the app to see what stations their driver is playing, then sign into their own Pandora account, and change the tunes to their liking.\nThis may seem like the sort of things that could irk drivers \u2013 after all, when the Spotify partnership was first announced, some were concerned that letting passengers choose the music would dehumanize the driver.\n\nBut on the flip side, many drivers today do\u00a0ask passengers if the music is okay or if the rider would\u00a0like to hear a different station, out of courtesy. By offering the ability to connect to Spotify or Pandora, the Uber app simply digitizes that switching experience, even if it doesn\u2019t remove the need for the accompanying social niceties that are involved. (You know, it\u2019s still nice to ask first.)\nPandora says that since its launch in the Uber driver app, drivers have played over 4 million hours of music \u2013 60 million songs \u2013 and the most popular stations have been\u00a0Drake, Future, Beyonc\u00e9, Adele and Bruno Mars.\nTo use the new feature on the rider side, you\u2019ll need to be booked on a music-connected Uber. That means the driver\u00a0has to have their phone connected via AUX, Bluetooth or USB; However, they don\u2019t have to have their own linked Pandora account, nor do they need to be currently streaming music.\n\nWhen the driver is on the way, you\u2019ll see the option appear to choose the music for your ride. And if the driver is already streaming Pandora, you can see what they\u2019re playing. You can then tap the music bar at the bottom of the screen, log into Pandora, and choose your station. When you get in your car, your music will begin\u00a0playing.\nThis is also how a rider\u00a0can choose to connect with a\u00a0Spotify Premium account, as before. Spotify integration is live now in all 59 markets where the music service is live.\nUber says that rider music is only available on iOS for now, with Android support in the works for a future release.","date":"2016-09-08T06:57:01","id":1382096,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/riders-can-now-stream-from-pandora-in-their-uber\/","slug":"riders-can-now-stream-from-pandora-in-their-uber","tags":[2868,217609],"title.rendered":"Riders can now stream from Pandora in their\u00a0Uber","views":440392},{"index":94,"author":521068,"categories":[24405894,14911,60523764,17396],"content.rendered":"Google announced today that it intends to purchase Apigee, an API management platform that went public last year, for $625 million or $17.40 a share.\nThe company, which helps customers\u00a0build digital products with open APIs, has an impressive customer list including\u00a0Walgreens, AT&T, Bechtel, Burberry, First Data and Live Nation.\nIn a blog post announcing the deal, Diane Greene, Google\u2019s senior vice president in charge of enterprise cloud computing described the product set using Walgreens as an example:\nWalgreens, for example, uses Apigee to manage the APIs that enable an ecosystem of partners and developers building apps using Walgreens APIs, including the Photo Prints API (enabling mobile app developers to include the ability for their app users to print photos at any Walgreens store), and the Prescription API (enabling users to quickly order refills of prescriptions right from their mobile app).\nShe certainly sees the value of adding an API management tool to her company\u2019s arsenal. \u201cThe addition of Apigee\u2019s API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers\u2019 move to supporting their businesses with high quality digital interactions. Apigee will make it much easier for the requisite APIs to be implemented and published with excellence,\u201d Greene wrote in the blog post.\nNot only is Google getting the technology and customer base, they are taking an Amazon Web Services customer in the process, a nice bonus.\nWhat we do know is that by acquiring Apigee,\u00a0Google gets an established player in the API management space with a strong customer list to help companies\u00a0going through the difficult process of becoming more digital. It\u2019s certainly interesting timing, given that Dell closed the massive EMC deal yesterday, and among its booty from that deal is Pivotal, a company that also helps organizations in their digital transformation.

It went public at $17 a share and closed the first day down\u00a01.9 percent. It would get worse as the stock dropped to a low of $5.45 a share on February 12th before beginning a steady climb upward, closing yesterday at $16.34 a share.\n\nIt seems less than a coincidence that the final selling price was just over the original IPO price.

The popularity contest that has become the election is diluting our time, attention and ability to think critically. Which is ironic, given that we are more connected to information than we have ever been before, and the computation necessary to model problems has never been cheaper.<\\/p>\\n<p>The only certainty in the election is that the results will have a dramatic impact on all citizens, businesses and organizations around the world. With war raging across continents, inaction in the face of climate change and the disparity of wealth threatening the stability of the economy and open flow of invention, an easy solution would be to point fingers and place blame.<\\/p>\\n<p>What we really need to do is rise to the greater level of civic duty that our culture needs to govern our increasingly complex world. We need to be more involved and have an actual say in how we are governed. For that reason, I am giving my company <span class=\\\"aBn\\\"><span class=\\\"aQJ\\\">November 8th<\\/span><\\/span> off to remove any impediments from their ability to vote.<\\/p>\\n<p>I grew up in New York,\\u00a0but I was born in Morocco. My grandfather, along with his brother and Allal al-Fassi, started the first political party in Morocco. I grew up admiring him as one of the founding fathers of modern politics in his country. I was raised with a real sense of civics, which I saw in action whenever we would visit Fez.<\\/p>\\n<p>Interestingly, Morocco was the first country to publicly recognize the United States as an official state with the ratification of the Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship in 1786. Signed by Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, it recognized Moroccan ports as open to U.S. ships and is the longest-standing unbroken treaty relationship in U.S. history.<\\/p>\\n<p>I am inspired by this history of diplomacy and always feel it important to be civic-minded. The commitment to make the world we live in one where countries and peoples are bound by productive relationships and trade is one of the driving forces as to why I\\u2019m an entrepreneur today. These early experiences also meaningfully impacted the kind of company I founded, the type of work we do and the team we recruit to be a part of, and contribute to, our bigger vision.<\\/p>\\n<p>Again, I am encouraging these core values at Enigma by declaring <span class=\\\"aBn\\\"><span class=\\\"aQJ\\\">November 8th<\\/span><\\/span> a mandatory holiday. True, some people can\\u2019t legally vote and perhaps some will abstain, but one thing is certain \\u2014 they can\\u2019t come in to work.<\\/p>\\n<p>Why? I am trying to remove any ounce of guilt that could be felt by a single team member for missing a meeting, a client call or any other professional activity because they wanted to vote. Most, I expect, will spend at least part of the day focused on their role in the future of American society and the world \\u2014 and that\\u2019s time well spent.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=\\u201dcenter\\u201d]I sit at an intersection of culture, identity, race and religion that made the U.S. the only place where I could earn the trust and opportunities that I have.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>I feel so much gratitude to have founded a company where not only can we afford to make such decisions, but where we all feel that this is simply the <i>right thing to do<\\/i>. With voter disenfranchisement issues still plaguing the citizenry, and many burdened by plight and diminishing wages, often working multiple jobs to make ends meet, we need to lead everywhere we can. We need to make a point about how important it is to care about everyone\\u2019s voice in this process.<\\/p>\\n<p>My biggest motivation is to respect the importance of being involved in the civic duties that are needed to protect the unique environment of the U.S. for entrepreneurs like myself. As a Muslim naturalized citizen of the U.S., married to a half-French, half-American Jewish woman with a two-year-old who holds three passports, I can assure you I sit at an intersection of culture, identity, race and religion that made the U.S. the only place where I could earn the trust and opportunities that I have. The opportunity to get a great education, the freedom from judgment by others and the support I needed to dream big \\u2014 these are sanctities that I\\u2019ve uniquely felt in the U.S. throughout my life. The U.S. is the only business environment where I would be able to run the company I do, the way I have.<\\/p>\\n<p>And I\\u2019m not the only one; 49 percent of entrepreneurs funded by the venture capital community are first- or second-generation immigrants. Inherently, these people are risk-takers; they don\\u2019t only represent the tail end of the American Dream, they\\u2019re the beginning of it. They\\u2019re uniquely resourceful, they get their bearings and are strong enough to build, rebuild and build again. Finally, they are grateful for the freedom and justice in the United States we have all fought so diligently to preserve and cultivate. Let\\u2019s not let this election threaten the openness of our society by remaining complacent in the face of several policies rooted in fear that could threaten our growth.<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>At Enigma, we focus on solving operational problems with data in the real world. That puts policy and regulation in the forefront of our minds. The very least we can do is rise up to the minimum requirement of voting for our president every four years.<\\/p>\\n<p>There is power in data, but it only helps us interpret the world when the point is to better it. I encourage you and your teams to join me and ensure that everyone who is entrusted with the right to vote wakes up on <span class=\\\"aBn\\\"><span class=\\\"aQJ\\\">November 8th\\u00a0<\\/span><\\/span>ready to stand up for a society that enables ingenuity and global transformation.<\\/p>\\n\",\"date\":\"2016-09-10T22:00:09\",\"id\":1380178,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/09\\/10\\/why-im-giving-my-company-election-day-off\\/\",\"slug\":\"why-im-giving-my-company-election-day-off\",\"tags\":[5648,331649,16799],\"title.rendered\":\"Why I\\u2019m giving my company Election Day\\u00a0off\",\"views\":478198},{\"index\":1,\"author\":321129,\"categories\":[25515,15986864,17396],\"content.rendered\":\"<p>[tc_contributor_byline slug=\\u201dlorelei-kelly\\u201d]<\\/p>\\n<p>With\\u00a0Congress\\u2019 approval ratings in the single digits, and in the midst of an ugly political season,\\u00a0our\\u00a0legislature might not appear as a hopeful place to start putting U.S. democracy\\u00a0back on track. And shows like \\u201cHouse of Cards\\u201d that depict\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0as sinister and conspiratorial don\\u2019t help its dismal reputation. The truth is less dystopian, if not as entertaining: Congress\\u00a0isn\\u2019t organized enough to be devious.<\\/p>\\n<p>If you look past the headlines to the slow but persistent\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/xml.house.gov\\/resources\\/TechTimeline.htm\\\">technological progress of\\u00a0Congress<\\/a>, you\\u2019ll see that the organization of\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0is changing in ways that will help it be a more informed, inclusive and effective democratic institution.\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0is in the process of adapting to the disruptive and data-driven demands of the 21st century. It is difficult to detect this progress on the outside, because, unlike the president and the executive branch, nobody speaks for\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0as a whole. The institution can\\u2019t defend itself, and therefore suffers disproportionately in today\\u2019s angry political discourse.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Moving from noise to knowledge<\\/h2>\\n<p>The unhinged rise of social media in public life, plus the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision to allow unlimited anonymous money into politics, has hit\\u00a0our\\u00a0democratic institutions at a vulnerable moment. Moreover, neither major party has made the modern institutional case for the importance of\\u00a0our\\u00a0first branch of government (Congress). If the political parties cared about\\u00a0democracy\\u00a0as much as they do about raising money, they would devote themselves to renewing\\u00a0our\\u00a0governing institutions and championing\\u00a0Congress.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Democrats would give\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0ways to experiment like the Brazilian Parliament, which features a hacker lab. The Republicans would be the guardians of the institution; they would insist on respectful codes of conduct and fact checking, like true conservatives.<\\/p>\\n<p>Both parties would seek out best practices in other legislatures that are modernizing representative\\u00a0democracy. The leadership would set aside campaigning to encourage their members to engage, experiment, learn and share on behalf of the institution. While valiant efforts exist on both sides of the aisle, helping the institution evolve in this way is not yet a high priority.<\\/p>\\n<p>More obvious is\\u00a0our\\u00a0legislature\\u2019s self-inflicted damage, primarily to its ability to engage in critical thinking. Congress\\u2019 problem managing knowledge is not an accident, it is an outcome. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.newamerica.org\\/oti\\/policy-papers\\/congress-wicked-problem\\/\\\">Congress gave itself a\\u00a0lobotomy in 1995,<\\/a> just a few years after the end of the Cold War, and on the cusp of the internet revolution. In the process, the GOP majority eliminated much of\\u00a0Congress\\u2019 capacity for critical thinking. The legislature\\u2019s science forecasting agency (the Office of Technology Assessment) was defunded.<\\/p>\\n<p>Seeing public sector infrastructure as competition to the private sector, the new leadership then wiped out the shared issue caucus staff \\u2014 which performed much of the continuing education on complex policy for members of both chambers and both parties. Keep in mind, these global public interests \\u2014 things like hunger, disease and nuclear security \\u2014 don\\u2019t have strong domestic constituencies, so they can\\u2019t compete with well-funded private interests or narrow advocacy tactics.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=\\u201dcenter\\u201d]If the political parties cared about democracy as much as they do about raising money, they would devote themselves to renewing our governing institutions.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>The policy-relevant entities who thrived inside\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0after this lobotomy were ideologically aligned \\u201cthink tanks\\u201d that took over substantive policy tasks and K Street lobbyists who began to have more and better policy intelligence at their fingertips than\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0did. The GOP also cut back the committees, diminishing institutional memory by getting rid of permanent committee staff.<\\/p>\\n<p>Finally, the Republicans \\u201cconsolidated\\u201d the Congressional Research Service (CRS) \\u2014\\u00a0the world\\u2019s premier legislative knowledge bank \\u2014 to severely restrict specialized knowledge. In fact, CRS did not have a dedicated intelligence expert on staff during the 2013 Snowden revelations, having never replaced their expert when\\u00a0he retired.<\\/p>\\n<h2>What is the excess capacity of democracy?<\\/h2>\\n<p>Congress\\u00a0needs a democratic content strategy. Like tech innovators in Silicon Valley, citizens who want to help build a 21st\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0can start by thinking about how technology can tap the excess capacity of\\u00a0our democracy. The\\u00a0first steps for\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0will be organizing the knowledge of geographic constituencies so that it is trusted and relevant, and then integrated into the stodgy, old processes of lawmaking.<\\/p>\\n<p>What is a new division of labor for civics when information is participatory? What are the rules of engagement for expanded inclusion? For disclosure of conflicts of interest? What new constituencies can you offer your member of\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0and your senators? Are you a technologist? How about checking in with the local staff and introducing them to the hacker community.<\\/p>\\n<p>Are you a data nerd? Develop a micro-media press list of district-based tweeters and Facebook or blog posters who are reputable, follow it up with a meet-up to authenticate participation and determine how to create usable formats (bonus if you can match expertise to the members\\u2019\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.committeemaps.org\\/\\\">committee assignments<\\/a>).<\\/p>\\n<p>Are you an events organizer? Help your member discover new ways to safely and productively engage with constituents on policy issues. Are you a community journalist? Create a dashboard together with your representative\\u2019s local staff that organizes relevant information. Tailor it for the members\\u2019 institutional responsibilities or for surge capacity in a crisis. Are you a low-tech online reader? Click through your member\\u2019s website and contact the front office with a list of dead links.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=\\u201dcenter\\u201d]Congress isn\\u2019t organized enough to be devious.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>Last year, a member office called me seeking Midwestern veterinarians with goat-herding knowledge for the Ebola hearings. Those veterinarians\\u2019 minds are the excess capacity of\\u00a0democracy. We need to create a decentralized decision support system for\\u00a0our\\u00a0legislature using this abundance \\u2014 one that complements the great work of\\u00a0Congress\\u2019 own knowledge resources.<\\/p>\\n<p>How about a question and answer site that lives through a season of hearings, maintained in the chair\\u2019s district by a public university or community college? Moreover, if the committees are falling behind on Capitol Hill, let\\u2019s move some of the hearings into the states so local experts and experienced constituents can weigh in. Thoughtful deliberation and learning can happen anywhere, after all.<\\/p>\\n<p>Across the globe, governance is in crisis. The reputation of\\u00a0democracy\\u00a0is at stake.\\u00a0Not just Americans, but the world\\u00a0needs\\u00a0our\\u00a0democratic institutions to do more than survive the present chaos \\u2014 we need them to thrive.

Facebook literally changed the way we think about an ad, from an interruptive display unit on the right side, to an actual piece of sponsored content in-feed that looks and feels just like the non-advertising content around it.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>Safe, lean ads: <\\/strong>Facebook doesn\\u2019t let ads weigh on load times. This is a big one \\u2014 and a major reason for Instant Articles. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2015\\/10\\/01\\/technology\\/personaltech\\/ad-blockers-mobile-iphone-browsers.html\\\">Slow page-load times on publisher properties are largely connected to the serving and tracking of ads<\\/a>, and the way users respond is to install ad blockers. That\\u2019s particularly sensitive on mobile, where data plans are at stake.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>Controllable ad experience:<\\/strong> And now, Facebook is leading the charge in providing users with precise controls over which ads they see, and from whom. That was the part that many people missed recently, when Facebook \\u201cblocked the blockers.\\u201d In so doing, they also introduced <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/08\\/11\\/friendblock\\/\\\">precise controls<\\/a> for users that allow them to dictate the kinds of ads they see.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p>Facebook is signaling to the broader advertising and publishing world that the future lies in fewer ads, more respect for consumer privacy and more deference to a user\\u2019s preferences.<\\/p>\\n<p>Many publishers are actually making solid efforts at delivering this type of experience themselves, but such efforts are going to waste because of the \\u201cbinary\\u201d and unsophisticated nature of most ad blockers. By blocking all ads on all sites, these blockers treat all publishers as the lowest common denominator, throwing premium publishers (and Facebook) in with the worst-offending sites on the web \\u2014 the ones that present the risk of malware, that invade privacy, that drag on load times, that ruin the user\\u2019s experience.<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>So while many have interpreted Facebook\\u2019s move to \\u201cblock the blockers\\u201d as a sign that Facebook is prioritizing its relationship to advertisers over users, it\\u2019s actually far more subtle. Facebook is trying to find \\u2014 and own \\u2014 the middle ground that neither advertisers nor publishers have been able to inhabit successfully.<\\/p>\\n<p>Odds are that Facebook <em>does<\\/em> find that middle ground. The question is whether the rest of the digital ecosystem can find it and maintain it independently. At the moment, the binary nature of ad blockers has forced each side (publishers and users) into entrenched positions that render the good faith attempts obsolete and leave the underlying causes of blocking unaddressed.<\\/p>\\n<p>If publishers respond by blocking blockers, or by increasing their ad load, users will only block more. And if users continue using indiscriminate blockers, publishers will have few good choices left.<\\/p>\\n<p>Far from simply waging war on the blockers, Facebook is trying to carve out the only middle ground that will be left when the war is over.<\\/p>\\n\",\"date\":\"2016-09-10T17:00:58\",\"id\":1380159,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/09\\/10\\/facebook-isnt-just-fighting-ad-blockers-its-fighting-the-underlying-causes-of-blocking\\/\",\"slug\":\"facebook-isnt-just-fighting-ad-blockers-its-fighting-the-underlying-causes-of-blocking\",\"tags\":[1624938,81819],\"title.rendered\":\"Facebook isn\\u2019t just fighting ad blockers, it\\u2019s fighting the underlying causes of\\u00a0blocking\",\"views\":316659},{\"index\":3,\"author\":321129,\"categories\":[25515,3457,17396],\"content.rendered\":\"<p>[tc_contributor_byline slug=\\u201dantoine-amann\\u201d]<\\/p>\\n<p>There\\u2019s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts.<\\/p>\\n<p><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/coschedule.com\\/blog\\/best-times-to-post-on-social-media\\/\\\">CoSchedule<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fastcompany.com\\/3036184\\/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything\\/the-best-and-worst-times-to-post-on-social-media-infograph\\\">Fast Company<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.hubspot.com\\/marketing\\/best-times-post-pin-tweet-social-media-infographic#sm.0001fy0lpkkgfbv10qu1t1vgwdr0z\\\">HubSpot<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.shortstack.com\\/the-best-times-to-post-on-social-media-infographic\\/\\\">ShortStack<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.forbes.com\\/sites\\/cherylsnappconner\\/2015\\/11\\/08\\/for-brands-and-pr-when-is-the-best-time-to-post-on-social-media\\/#74b7590a7c9f\\\">Forbes<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/blog.hootsuite.com\\/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-twitter-instagram\\/\\\">Hootsuite<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.quicksprout.com\\/2015\\/01\\/02\\/what-are-the-best-times-to-post-on-social-media\\/\\\">QuickSprout<\\/a> and others all claim to have the\\u00a0answers to such seemingly\\u00a0simple\\u00a0questions as \\u201cWhen is the\\u00a0best\\u00a0time\\u00a0to post on\\u00a0Facebook?\\u201d and \\u201cHow often should you post stories on Facebook?\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>However, many of the strategies used by publishers for optimizing engagement and boosting referral traffic from social are flawed. Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that\\u00a0there\\u00a0are\\u00a0no\\u00a0universal \\u201cbest\\u00a0times\\u201d to\\u00a0share\\u00a0content on\\u00a0Facebook.<\\/p>\\n<p>We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from\\u00a0Facebook\\u00a0three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year\\u2019s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn\\u2019t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.<\\/p>\\n<p>Firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1380163\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/threenewspublishers_differentregions_version1.png?w=738&h=416\\\" alt=\\\"threeNewsPublishers_differentRegions_version1\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"416\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>As can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved\\u00a0best\\u00a0performance when sharing between\\u00a011am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times.<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>It\\u2019s clear\\u00a0there\\u00a0is\\u00a0no\\u00a0one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category \\u2014 optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. One explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns.<\\/p>\\n<p>The natural next question is whether\\u00a0there\\u00a0are country-wide\\u00a0best\\u00a0times for posting stories on\\u00a0Facebook. Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can\\u00a0there\\u00a0be specific guides per country?<\\/p>\\n<p>We compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before\\u00a010am\\u00a0they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1380164\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/frenchnewsandfrenchsports-1.png?w=738&h=416\\\" alt=\\\"FrenchNewsAndFrenchSports-1\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"416\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>Overall, the sports publisher\\u2019s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country,\\u00a0there\\u00a0are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content.<\\/p>\\n<p>We also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers.\\u00a0There\\u00a0were still crucial differences \\u2014 when one publisher experienced a peak in\\u00a0share\\u00a0performance at\\u00a011am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1380165\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/twoleadingfrenchnewspublishers-1.png?w=738&h=416\\\" alt=\\\"TwoLeadingFrenchNewsPublishers-1\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"416\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>Interestingly, there\\u00a0also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at\\u00a0220,000\\u00a0Facebook\\u00a0posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them\\u00a0according\\u00a0to the\\u00a0time\\u00a0of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local\\u00a0time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1380166\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/sport_technology.png?w=738&h=416\\\" alt=\\\"Sport_Technology\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"416\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>Again,\\u00a0there\\u00a0are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.<\\/p>\\n<p>But even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time\\u00a0basis due to strong daily fluctuations. Indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance \\u2014 with large social media teams and even data scientists.<\\/p>\\n\",\"date\":\"2016-09-10T15:00:10\",\"id\":1380155,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/09\\/10\\/whens-the-best-time-to-share-on-facebook\\/\",\"slug\":\"whens-the-best-time-to-share-on-facebook\",\"tags\":[449553212,81819,8103495],\"title.rendered\":\"When\\u2019s the best time to share on\\u00a0Facebook?\",\"views\":352494},{\"index\":4,\"author\":521068,\"categories\":[24405894,15328,17396],\"content.rendered\":\"<p>Box CEO Aaron Levie has been at it for more than a decade.

It is difficult to detect this progress on the outside, because, unlike the president and the executive branch, nobody speaks for\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0as a whole. The institution can&#8217;t defend itself, and therefore suffers disproportionately in today&#8217;s angry political discourse.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Moving from noise to knowledge<\\/h2>\\n<p>The unhinged rise of social media in public life, plus the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to allow unlimited anonymous money into politics, has hit\\u00a0our\\u00a0democratic institutions at a vulnerable moment. Moreover, neither major party has made the modern institutional case for the importance of\\u00a0our\\u00a0first branch of government (Congress). If the political parties cared about\\u00a0democracy\\u00a0as much as they do about raising money, they would devote themselves to renewing\\u00a0our\\u00a0governing institutions and championing\\u00a0Congress.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Democrats would give\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0ways to experiment like the Brazilian Parliament, which features a hacker lab. The Republicans would be the guardians of the institution; they would insist on respectful codes of conduct and fact checking, like true conservatives.<\\/p>\\n<p>Both parties would seek out best practices in other legislatures that are modernizing representative\\u00a0democracy. The leadership would set aside campaigning to encourage their members to engage, experiment, learn and share on behalf of the institution. While valiant efforts exist on both sides of the aisle, helping the institution evolve in this way is not yet a high priority.<\\/p>\\n<p>More obvious is\\u00a0our\\u00a0legislature&#8217;s self-inflicted damage, primarily to its ability to engage in critical thinking. Congress\\u2019 problem managing knowledge is not an accident, it is an outcome. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.newamerica.org\\/oti\\/policy-papers\\/congress-wicked-problem\\/\\\">Congress gave itself a\\u00a0lobotomy in 1995,<\\/a> just a few years after the end of the Cold War, and on the cusp of the internet revolution. In the process, the GOP majority eliminated much of\\u00a0Congress&#8217; capacity for critical thinking. The legislature&#8217;s science forecasting agency (the Office of Technology Assessment) was defunded.<\\/p>\\n<p>Seeing public sector infrastructure as competition to the private sector, the new leadership then wiped out the shared issue caucus staff &#8212; which performed much of the continuing education on complex policy for members of both chambers and both parties. Keep in mind, these global public interests &#8212; things like hunger, disease and nuclear security &#8212; don&#8217;t have strong domestic constituencies, so they can&#8217;t compete with well-funded private interests or narrow advocacy tactics.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;center&#8221;]If the political parties cared about democracy as much as they do about raising money, they would devote themselves to renewing our governing institutions.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n<p>The policy-relevant entities who thrived inside\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0after this lobotomy were ideologically aligned &#8220;think tanks&#8221; that took over substantive policy tasks and K Street lobbyists who began to have more and better policy intelligence at their fingertips than\\u00a0Congress\\u00a0did. The GOP also cut back the committees, diminishing institutional memory by getting rid of permanent committee staff.<\\/p>\\n<p>Finally, the Republicans &#8220;consolidated&#8221; the Congressional Research Service (CRS) &#8212;\\u00a0the world&#8217;s premier legislative knowledge bank &#8212; to severely restrict specialized knowledge.

To put that in perspective, that\\u2019s up from around 0 percent just 10 years ago. Facebook is absolutely crushing them in mobile, too, where the real user growth is &#8212; and there, it\\u2019s not even close.<\\/p>\\n<p>That\\u2019s the reality, and it\\u2019s led a lot of publishers to conclude they\\u2019d be better off not competing with Facebook for eyeballs, choosing instead to forsake the exclusivity of their own properties and publish directly to the social network. Many side observers now believe we will soon witness the end of the <em>dot-com <\\/em>&#8212; i.e. the wholesale migration of content away from independent publisher properties and onto Facebook.<\\/p>\\n<p>The thing is, Facebook has <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2016\\/06\\/30\\/technology\\/facebook-to-change-news-feed-to-focus-on-friends-and-family.html\\\">demonstrated recently that it\\u2019s willing to change its algorithm<\\/a> whenever it wants, and that publishers can\\u2019t rely on it as a stable channel. A savior for publishers Facebook is not. Indeed, publishers&#8217;\\u00a0anxiety is both very real and very justified.<\\/p>\\n<p>How did this happen? The obvious interpretation is that Facebook has the scale, the traffic and, thus, the leverage. But that\\u2019s not all there is to it. Facebook has actually been a pioneer in finding the <em>right <\\/em>way to monetize their audience without pissing it off. And this is where its recent moves against ad blocking become very, very interesting.<\\/p>\\n<p>First, it\\u2019s worth reviewing what Facebook is doing right in its audience monetization strategy:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fewer ads: <\\/strong>Facebook decided <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.mediapost.com\\/publications\\/article\\/230756\\/facebook-begins-reducing-number-of-ads-boosts-pri.html?edition=\\\">to show people fewer ads<\\/a> and thus are able to charge more for them. They actually come out with more revenue than if they showed more ads for less money. Fewer ads also helps the user experience, thus reducing the motivation for users to block.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>Non-interruptive ads: <\\/strong>Facebook has pioneered the non-interruptive advertising experience. Facebook literally changed the way we think about an ad, from an interruptive display unit on the right side, to an actual piece of sponsored content in-feed that looks and feels just like the non-advertising content around it.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>Safe, lean ads: <\\/strong>Facebook doesn\\u2019t let ads weigh on load times. This is a big one &#8212; and a major reason for Instant Articles. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2015\\/10\\/01\\/technology\\/personaltech\\/ad-blockers-mobile-iphone-browsers.html\\\">Slow page-load times on publisher properties are largely connected to the serving and tracking of ads<\\/a>, and the way users respond is to install ad blockers. That\\u2019s particularly sensitive on mobile, where data plans are at stake.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>Controllable ad experience:<\\/strong> And now, Facebook is leading the charge in providing users with precise controls over which ads they see, and from whom. That was the part that many people missed recently, when Facebook &#8220;blocked the blockers.&#8221; In so doing, they also introduced <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/08\\/11\\/friendblock\\/\\\">precise controls<\\/a> for users that allow them to dictate the kinds of ads they see.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p>Facebook is signaling to the broader advertising and publishing world that the future lies in fewer ads, more respect for consumer privacy and more deference to a user\\u2019s preferences.<\\/p>\\n<p>Many publishers are actually making solid efforts at delivering this type of experience themselves, but such efforts are going to waste because of the \\u201cbinary\\u201d and unsophisticated nature of most ad blockers. By blocking all ads on all sites, these blockers treat all publishers as the lowest common denominator, throwing premium publishers (and Facebook) in with the worst-offending sites on the web &#8212; the ones that present the risk of malware, that invade privacy, that drag on load times, that ruin the user&#8217;s experience.<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>So while many have interpreted Facebook\\u2019s move to \\u201cblock the blockers\\u201d as a sign that Facebook is prioritizing its relationship to advertisers over users, it\\u2019s actually far more subtle. Facebook is trying to find &#8212; and own &#8212; the middle ground that neither advertisers nor publishers have been able to inhabit successfully.<\\/p>\\n<p>Odds are that Facebook <em>does<\\/em> find that middle ground. The question is whether the rest of the digital ecosystem can find it and maintain it independently. At the moment, the binary nature of ad blockers has forced each side (publishers and users) into entrenched positions that render the good faith attempts obsolete and leave the underlying causes of blocking unaddressed.<\\/p>\\n<p>If publishers respond by blocking blockers, or by increasing their ad load, users will only block more. And if users continue using indiscriminate blockers, publishers will have few good choices left.<\\/p>\\n<p>Far from simply waging war on the blockers, Facebook is trying to carve out the only middle ground that will be left when the war is over.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Many have interpreted Facebook\\u2019s move to \\u201cblock the blockers\\u201d as a sign that Facebook is prioritizing its relationship to advertisers over users.

Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that\\u00a0there\\u00a0are\\u00a0no\\u00a0universal &#8220;best\\u00a0times&#8221; to\\u00a0share\\u00a0content on\\u00a0Facebook.<\\/p>\\n<p>We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from\\u00a0Facebook\\u00a0three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year\\u2019s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn\\u2019t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.<\\/p>\\n<p>Firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1380163\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/threenewspublishers_differentregions_version1.png?w=738&#038;h=416\\\" alt=\\\"threeNewsPublishers_differentRegions_version1\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"416\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>As can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved\\u00a0best\\u00a0performance when sharing between\\u00a011am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times.

Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans?

By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1380164\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/frenchnewsandfrenchsports-1.png?w=738&#038;h=416\\\" alt=\\\"FrenchNewsAndFrenchSports-1\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"416\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>Overall, the sports publisher\\u2019s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories.

We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local\\u00a0time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1380166\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/sport_technology.png?w=738&#038;h=416\\\" alt=\\\"Sport_Technology\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"416\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>Again,\\u00a0there\\u00a0are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.<\\/p>\\n<p>But even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time\\u00a0basis due to strong daily fluctuations.

Using a drag-and-drop interface, the system essentially lets you build and deploy native apps, visually. In this way, non-developers are able to create and deploy mobile apps.<\\/p>\\n<p>The company originally focused on selling app development to startups but soon found that &#8220;citizen developers&#8221; inside of big enterprise organizations were using the platform to make one-off apps for data collection. The company recently added a number of enterprise-ready features as a result including encrypted connections, powerful database tools, and improved GPS location management. This means that a lay user in a corporation could use the platform to track deliveries, collect insurance claims in the field, or simply create time-tracking apps.<\\/p>\\n<p>Historically I have been suspect of platform approaches like this. When I first encountered these kinds of tools a few years ago, their main use was for developers to be able to build mobile apps for multiple operating systems (like iOS, Android, Blackberry) from a single logical base of business rules and then publish multiple apps simultaneously.<\\/p>\\n<p>Not being a hardcore developer myself, I heard different opinions from different developers at that time. More traditional developers I spoke with loved the idea and were hopeful that there could be massive time savings. Mobile developers I spoke with were pessimistic and thought the tools would be brittle and inflexible for solving true mobile solutions in native languages.<\\/p>\\n<p>But Kinetise&#8217;s system is far more robust than others I&#8217;ve seen and honestly what interested me the most about it\\u00a0were some of the outcomes the team discovered.<\\/p>\\n<p>In a quick skype call with Kinetize&#8217;s CEO Piotr Pawlak, he described a key\\u00a0insight he and his team noticed prior to one deployment.<br \\/>\\n&#8220;We started our product as an easy way to make native apps. We were pretty popular with startups and experimenters but we saw something really interesting: enterprises were using our product to make one-off apps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We did a little research and it looks like enterprise is following what Gartner called the &#8220;Citizen Developers&#8221; model: they\\u2019re building internal apps instead of web pages.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Therein lies one of Kinetise&#8217;s strengths. It is a rapid development program for internal, enterprise apps.\\u00a0Granted, the platform still has a way to build apps for regular public deployment in app stores too, but enterprise seems to be a major target and strength.<\\/p>\\n<p>I can see this advantage, as there are definitely many,\\u00a0large workforces of\\u00a0remote, mobile, enterprise workers out there who need mobile tools that have the ability to\\u00a0function &#8220;offline&#8221; when network connectivity is not possible. For these scenarios, native mobile apps are a great solution and would have an advantage over mobile websites.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Kinetise is not another template-based apps creator,&#8221; said Pawlak. &#8220;We are not building apps for restaurants, beauty-parlors, etc. We offer real, custom apps, but without coding.

Its premise is that, when it comes to populist revolt, we may have seen nothing yet &#8230; If you think globalization, immigration, trade and demographic change have contributed to displacement and political anger, wait until robots take away millions and millions of jobs, including those requiring the use of a well-trained brain.\\n<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>I&#8217;ve argued that myself, in the past, but the lack of any actual evidence of automation-driven net job destruction now gives me pause. It may be a moot point, though. The question of whether robots will eat all the jobs is orthogonal to the question of whether people <i>believe<\\/i> robots will eat all the jobs &#8212; and whether the tech industry will be viewed as the oppressors of the masses.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I really think the pitchforks and torches are coming for us in tech,&#8221; mused a member of Business Insider&#8217;s &#8220;<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.businessinsider.com\\/the-silicon-valley-100-ranked-1-to-100-2016-6\\\">Silicon Valley 100<\\/a>&#8221; to me over dinner a couple of months ago. (To his credit he&#8217;d be the first to roll his eyes at the existence of such an appellation.) I&#8217;ve certainly noticed, during my five years living in the Bay Area, a distinct rise in the use of &#8220;techie&#8221; as an epithet.<\\/p>\\n<p>My point being: it seems reasonable to expect the rise of new protests, and new <i>kinds<\\/i> of protests, aimed not just at political institutions \\u00e0 la Occupy; not just at injustices \\u00e0 la Black Lives Matter and the current pipeline protests in North Dakota; but aimed directly at the tech industry. We&#8217;ve seen some of that before, with stones thrown at Google buses, but that was really more about housing than tech. I&#8217;m talking about protestors who believe that the tech industry is a greedy, exploitative, and increasingly powerful behemoth which uses its power to reify rather than repair existing social inequalities and injustices.<\\/p>\\n<p>I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s true, on the whole, but I do think there are uncomfortable grains of truth in that accusation. As Andrew Yang of Venture for America writes in <i>Quartz<\\/i>, &#8220;<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/qz.com\\/772173\\/the-only-startup-founders-who-can-embrace-failure-are-the-ones-privileged-enough-to-survive-it\\/\\\">the only startup founders who can embrace failure are the ones privileged enough to survive it<\\/a>.&#8221; The annual diversity reports from such wildly successful and progressive companies as Apple and Google make grim reading each year.<\\/p>\\n<p>Certainly the Occupy people think the perpetuation of unfair advantages is <i>capitalism&#8217;s<\\/i> fault, not <i>technology<\\/i>&#8216;s, but, er, the distinction between &#8220;capitalism&#8221; and &#8220;the tech industry&#8221; grows pretty fine in an era in which the world&#8217;s five most valuable public companies are Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft &#8212; the same five tech titans that Bruce Sterling singled out as &#8220;the Stacks&#8221; <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.theatlantic.com\\/technology\\/archive\\/2012\\/12\\/bruce-sterling-on-why-it-stopped-making-sense-to-talk-about-the-internet-in-2012\\/266674\\/\\\">some years ago<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p><i>The End Of Protest<\\/i>, after putting Occupy in (fascinating) historical context, identifies the reason that protests fail as a kind of entitled naivete &#8212; the bizarre belief that if you get a million people out onto the street demonstrating, then governments will <i>have<\\/i> to respect that and change course, because it clearly represents the will of the people.<\\/p>\\n<p>Interestingly, a lot of what White says about protests and revolution is what tech VCs say about startup. That the real secret to success is timing: every so often, the zeitgeist will sweep you along on its tidal wave (which is actually what happened to Occupy, which quickly grew beyond its wildest initial dreams &#8212; and yet still failed.) That &#8220;the best methods of protest are unrecognized because they defy our expectations of what a protest should look like,&#8221; which echoes VCs&#8217; lament that many of the best ideas sound crazy at first. That &#8220;if we innovate, we win.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>(I would remiss not to note that White also writes at length about spiritual paths and spiritual process; this being anything but my area of expertise, I&#8217;m going to refrain from commenting on that.)<\\/p>\\n<p>There will be a certain dramatic irony if the tech industry finds itself facing protestors who adopt the very meta-algorithms of the modern tech industry: ignore history, try many different ideas even if they sound crazy, fail fast and pivot, scale sideways, accept that timing dictates success, etcetera. (Shades of the notion of left-wing <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.publicbooks.org\\/nonfiction\\/on-accelerationism\\\">accelerationism<\\/a>.)

Tech companies can\\u2019t find enough skilled people, and veterans are looking for exciting careers to utilize their skills. It should be the perfect match.<\\/p>\\n<p>But as I talked to a number of veterans looking for jobs in the tech industry, many were frustrated that employers often didn\\u2019t know how to interpret the relevance of their skills or appreciate their capacity for such all-purpose skills as rapid learning, leadership and pure smarts.<\\/p>\\n<p>That realization nearly three years ago led me to cold-call a group called\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.vetsintech.co\\/\\\">VetsinTech<\\/a>. I\\u2019m not a military veteran myself, but I wanted to help; as a venture capitalist, I get to work with a lot of people in tech companies. At the time, VetsinTech was just a small operation with a mission to help train, connect and find jobs for military veterans wanting careers in tech.<\\/p>\\n<p>What happened next inspired all of us.

This included training workshops, mentor sessions and even hackathons to introduce to some of the most exciting tech companies across the country talented men and women who had served in our armed forces. Katherine pointed out recently that over the next five years,\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.dailydot.com\\/via\\/veterans-tech-silicon-valley-military\\/\\\">approximately one million servicemen and women will return to the workforce<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;left&#8221;]Military veterans are growing and, in some cases, transforming their careers at technology companies.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>We also found that veterans make some of the best entrepreneurs.

I disagree.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Raise Long Before You Raise<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Scrap around and find a way to get warm intros early. It\\u2019s like picking a partner for anything important \\u2013 tapping into your network and doing your homework on who is interested in your space, who\\u2019s actually insightful in the space and good to work with, means you\\u2019ll have a lay of the land before you desperately need money.<\\/p>\\n<p>Why would they want to meet with you? Well, figure out what you know about the industry that\\u2019s interesting to them, what\\u2019s intrinsic to their portfolio companies, and make that the hook. Once they understand your capabilities, you\\u2019ve started the process.<\\/p>\\n<p>Like any relationship, it takes some care and nurturing, but it\\u2019s worth it, because the relationship sets the foundation for them to take that leap of faith when you\\u2019re bringing them an idea to fund. Even if they\\u2019re interested in the space and the product is intriguing, the leap of faith is team x product x market.<\\/p>\\n<p>It\\u2019s not additive, it\\u2019s multiplicative and if any of them are zero, it takes the entire equation down to zero. So, especially in this anemic macro-economic environment, it\\u2019s a lot less risky for them if they feel like they already have a sense of the team.<\\/p>\\n<p>If you know them before you take money from them, it\\u2019s good after the money hits the bank too. You start with higher credibility and a better understanding of one another\\u2019s working styles before the first board meeting. You have a more acute understanding of their beliefs around the space and there\\u2019s a foundation of trust and benefit of the doubt in the face of any conflicts.<\\/p>\\n<p>In short, if they know you and trust you, they\\u2019ll be a lot more open to your ideas after the funding hits and a lot more likely to make that leap and write you the check in the first place. It\\u2019s not rocket science, but it does take a good amount of elbow grease up front and a substantial amount of prep and time.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Fire Faster<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I have yet to hear a CEO or founder say they regret firing someone too quickly. Seriously. We have a rough rule of thumb &#8211; if there\\u2019s a team member I\\u2019ve had a conversation five or more times in about the span of a month (and that includes other people coming and giving feedback, me having discussions on what to do for them with co-founders, etc), we know we have a serious problem.<\\/p>\\n<p>The worst thing we can do is let that problem fester. We know we either have to resolve it fast, or let the person go.<\\/p>\\n<p>There are a hundred reasons we wait too long. It\\u2019s the part of my job that I hate the most. I hate it so much it triggers a physical reaction for me. I know and care about every single member of our team. I know about their sick parent, their spouse that\\u2019s having trouble finding a job, all of it, and I take all of it home with me.<\\/p>\\n<p>The decision to let someone go is never made lightly and it always costs something emotionally. The key indicator for me is if thoughts of the situation or person come flooding in right before bed or right when I get up, I already know what needs to be done, I just don\\u2019t want to do it. But that\\u2019s exactly when the team needs me to suck it up and get it done for them.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Walk and Talk<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I get 6-8 miles a day by walking during my one-to-ones and pacing during calls. Headsets are a great thing. This is most of my exercise for the week, and my doctor says I\\u2019ve never been in better cardiovascular shape. Seriously, my resting heart rate is in the low 60\\u2019s now!<\\/p>\\n<p>But, the biggest benefit is that people feel more free to talk about the hard things if you\\u2019re not sitting across the table, staring at them. If I really want to hear what someone thinks, I\\u2019ll ask them to walk with me.<\\/p>\\n<p>Now the whole team does this with one another and it\\u2019s become part of our culture. I also think people have better ideas when they\\u2019re walking and the blood is flowing. I find that walking side-by-side, facing the same direction, it has the effect of making it feel more like we\\u2019re solving a problem together, or that the solution or idea is ours as opposed to mine or theirs.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>The Hidden Benefits of Your Advisory Board<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Most people think of an advisory board as just advising on functional areas along with some strategy. Of course, we\\u2019ve included domain experts to help us in areas where we need it \\u2013 and there are plenty of those \\u2013 but there are less obvious benefits to an advisory board, too.<\\/p>\\n<p>The first is recruiting. The referral aspect of this is obvious, as advisors all have their own extensive networks. The bigger bonus is having them help you close on a candidate you really want. From the candidate\\u2019s point of view, they\\u2019re more objective than an employee or an investor in the company. They\\u2019re also a great conduit for ongoing correspondence with the candidate after you\\u2019ve made the offer.<\\/p>\\n<p>You can have contact with a potential hire every 24-48 hours without making them feel like someone from the company is bugging them or pressuring them to make a decision.<\\/p>\\n<p>The second benefit is on the fundraising side. Every investor has people that influence their opinions and if some of your advisors happen to be those people\\u2026 That they\\u2019re willing to go to bat for you and support you is a massive reputational benefit, which is something that can\\u2019t be overstated when you\\u2019re asking a person to make that leap of faith. The third benefit is that they\\u2019re usually more than happy to spread the word when you go to press, a time when it\\u2019s important that all the talking doesn\\u2019t come from you. You need as many different types of advocates as you can get. The right group of advisors is chomping at the bit and raring to go at press time.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Don\\u2019t Discount the Kitchen Cabinet<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>There\\u2019s only one CEO but there are a lot of team members. There are days where you give and give and end up feeling a little emotionally tapped out.<\\/p>\\n<p>That\\u2019s where my ladies come in, my Kitchen Cabinet.

The move came only after PayPal ignored their requests for a formal meeting.<\\/p>\\n<p>PayPal currently does not work for Palestinians in the West Bank or Gaza, but <em>does work<\\/em> for Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal by international law. Israelis and Palestinians also all use the same currency, the Israeli Shekels. But quite how an Internet platform could work in some areas of a country but not in another \\u2014 where the areas in question are are in some cases literally meters apart \\u2014 is puzzling to say the least.<\\/p>\\n<p>The group behind the hashtag and the letter, Americans for a Vibrant Palestinian Economy (A4VPE), ask PayPal CEO Daniel Shulman (pictured) to consider the fact that PayPal operates in 203 countries, many of which could be considered far less stable than Palestine, including Somalia and Yemen. Yemen is currently engaged in a devastating civil war, while Somalia has been war-torn for many years.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have been told that PayPal is concerned about the compliance investments required to enter the Palestinian market.

After working tirelessly to win business in the global marketplace, they then have to pay steep fees for wire transfers or foreign banks to get paid. PayPal opening here is one of the most immediately impactful moves that could be done to support the economy here. Gazans we work with can&#8217;t understand why PayPal serves Israelis living in the West Bank and is open for business in counties like Yemen and Somalia, but not here. Businesses in Gaza and the West Bank just want access to the same opportunities PayPal affords to the other 200 countries and territories they serve.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>TechCrunch contacted PayPal for its response and they sent us this statement: \\u201cPayPal&#8217;s ambition is for everyone ultimately to have access to our services for digital payments and commerce, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  We appreciate the interest that the Palestinian community has shown in PayPal. While we do not have anything to announce for the immediate future, we continuously work to develop strategic partnerships, address business feasibility, regulatory, and compliance needs and requirements, and acquire the necessary local authority permissions for new market entries.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>PayPal has a major operation in Israel <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.haaretz.com\\/misc\\/iphone-article\\/.premium-1.584128\\\">in the form of its risk team<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>Palestine produces roughly 2,000 IT graduates per year. Both the West Bank and Gaza now have a number of technology companies which, ironically, see tech as a way of developing their economy, just as the Israelis do.<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p>August 23, 2016<\\/p>\\n<p>Mr. Daniel H. Schulman<br \\/>\\nPresident and CEO<br \\/>\\nPayPal<br \\/>\\n2211 North First Street<br \\/>\\nSan Jose, CA 95131<\\/p>\\n<p>Dear Mr. Schulman,<\\/p>\\n<p>We are writing to urge you to extend PayPal\\u2019s services to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza thereby removing a major limitation on the Palestinian technology sector, one of the only bright spots in the overall economy. More importantly, extending PayPal services would resolve the current discriminatory situation whereby PayPal\\u2019s payment portal can be accessed freely by Israeli settlers living illegally (per international humanitarian law) in the West Bank while it remains unavailable to the occupied Palestinian population.<\\/p>\\n<p>PayPal\\u2019s absence is a major obstacle to the growth of Palestine\\u2019s tech sector and the overall economy. While other payment portals are available, there is no replacement for the trust and familiarity that PayPal inspires among potential users, particularly those that are unfamiliar with Palestine-based companies. Without access to PayPal, Palestinian entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and others face routine difficulties in receiving payments for business and charitable purposes. Moreover, PayPal\\u2019s absence is problematic for the overall Palestinian economy as tech is one of the only sectors with the potential to grow under status quo conditions of the Israeli occupation which severely restricts the internal and cross-border movement of goods and people. Indeed, by entering the Palestinian market, PayPal has the opportunity to make a significant contribution toward alleviating the destabilizing unemployment rates of over 25% in the West Bank and 40% in Gaza.<\\/p>\\n<p>We have been told that PayPal is concerned about the compliance investments required to enter the Palestinian market. We believe such costs have been greatly overestimated. The U.S. Treasury Department has spent a great deal of time working with the Palestine Monetary Authority to strengthen safeguards against abuse. PayPal currently operates in over 203 countries including places with major problems of corruption and terrorism like Somalia and Yemen. We are confident that Palestine will prove a much easier place to profitably do business than these and other markets that PayPal has already entered.<\\/p>\\n<p>In addition to business reasons, there are also ethical reasons for PayPal to enter the Palestinian market. PayPal\\u2019s decision to launch its service in Israel for Israeli bank customers means that it inadvertently made its services freely available to Jewish settlers living illegally in the occupied West Bank. Palestinians living in close proximity to those settlers do not, however, have access as PayPal doesn\\u2019t work with Palestinian banks and Palestinians are unable to establish Israeli bank accounts. We believe a company like PayPal, whose actions in North Carolina reaffirmed its commitment to equal rights, would agree that people living in the same neighborhood ought to have equal rights and access to its services regardless of religion or ethnicity.<\\/p>\\n<p>We understand that entering a new market can be complex and would be more than happy to work with you, the Palestinian Monetary Authority, and any other necessary officials to pave the way for PayPal\\u2019s entry to the Palestinian market.<\\/p>\\n<p>We very much look forward to hearing from you and working with you to ensure that Palestinian entrepreneurs, nonprofits, and others are free to participate in global commerce.

Consequently, the end result of <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> could be theoretically regressive in nature by reducing the benefits of the poor and transferring that revenue instead to the middle classes and the rich.

That is the steepest of \\u201cbenefit cliffs\\u201d and it\\u2019s the equivalent of taxing those with disabilities at rates far greater than 100 percent as a reward for their labor. It\\u2019s also the exact opposite of a <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> that is never taken away.<\\/p>\\n<p>It is this clawback of means-tested benefits with the earning of <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> that is possibly the single greatest flaw of all targeted assistance, and also the single most ignored detail when people defend the current system over the introduction of a <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> that would replace it. Simply put, $1,000 per month in <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> is not at all the same thing as $1,000 per month in <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span>.

[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>The regressive argument operates on the myth that for every four people living under the poverty line, four people get an amount of assistance that lifts them far above the poverty line, and that $1 of <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> is exactly equivalent to $1 in <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span>.<\\/p>\\n<p>The <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> argument operates on the reality that for every four people living under the poverty line, only about one person gets an amount of assistance that does more to trap them in poverty than to lift them out of it, and that $1 of <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> is worth far less than $1 of <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span>.<\\/p>\\n<p>It\\u2019s really important to understand this, so let\\u2019s zoom in a bit on a worst-<span class=\\\"il\\\">case<\\/span> scenario. Let\\u2019s assume we replace all of our programs targeted at the poor with UBI, including even Medicaid (which I don&#8217;t recommend unless we replace it with universal healthcare instead), and that we provide the UBI to adults only, with nothing for kids (<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.scottsantens.com\\/why-should-adults-with-kids-get-more-basic-income-child-allowances\\\">something else I don\\u2019t recommend<\\/a>).<\\/p>\\n<p>Using <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.scottsantens.com\\/will-replacing-current-benefits-with-cash-tomorrow-leave-todays-recipients-better-or-worse-off-basic-income-single-parents-welfare\\\">an example of a single parent with two kids<\\/a> within the current system, we could regressively replace around $45,000 of benefits (if we also eliminate child care, which is yet another detail I don&#8217;t recommend) with $12,000 in cash. That is a worst-design scenario and totally regressive right? No. It\\u2019s actually partially regressive and mostly <span class=\\\"il\\\">progressive<\\/span>.<\\/p>\\n<p>Although true that one in four would be worse off in such an inferior UBI design, it\\u2019s also true that three of four would be far better off because they would no longer receive little to nothing. As an oversimplified example for the sake of clarity, that means instead of the distribution across four adults being $45,000\\/$0\\/$0\\/$0, it would be $12,000\\/$12,000\\/$12,000\\/$12,000. That is more <span class=\\\"il\\\">progressive<\\/span> as a whole than it is regressive, and inequality is reduced overall, not increased, because the total at the bottom went from $45,000 across four people to $48,000 across four people. And that is for basically the worst possible, most unrealistic of UBI designs.<\\/p>\\n<p>But again, those numbers cannot be compared dollar for dollar. <span class=\\\"il\\\">Welfare<\\/span> dollars disappear with work and <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> dollars are kept with work. That same parent receiving $45,000 for nothing, if they got a job paying $30,000 right now would receive $20,000 in benefits. That would be a gain of $30,000 combined with a loss of $25,000. That\\u2019s a gain of $5,000 for a $30,000 job, or in other words, an <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> tax of 83 percent. Who else is taxed at 83 percent? No one. In fact, the richest are taxed the least because their <span class=\\\"il\\\">income,<\\/span> which isn&#8217;t derived from work, is special. It&#8217;s simply capital gains, which is taxed at 20 percent.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;left&#8221;]Does this sound like a just and equitable system? Or does it sound more like a racist meat-grinder?[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>Even more troubling, <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> dollars themselves are not equivalent to each other. Despite it being against the law to vary <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> dollars along racial lines, that\\u2019s exactly what we do. How? It\\u2019s again due to the nature of block grants for states. When Bill Clinton signed his <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> reform into law, he agreed to write checks to the states and let them handle how they dish out <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span>. As a result, just five years after <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> was reformed into what it is today, 63 percent of those in the programs with the least-harsh conditions were white and 11 percent were black, while 63 percent of those in the programs with the most-harsh conditions were black and 29 percent were white.<\\/p>\\n<p>In other words, a dollar in <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> has about three to five times as many strings for someone who is black than someone who is white. These strings absolutely affect end results.

Or does it sound more like a racist meat-grinder?<\\/p>\\n<p>The bare naked truth of our present <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> system is a racially biased, overly paternalistic, unnecessarily controlling, grossly exclusionary system of punishment and blame that limits opportunity and taxes working beneficiaries more than any other worker in any <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> tax bracket.<\\/p>\\n<p>It doesn\\u2019t abolish poverty. It helps sustain it. And this is the system establishment voices wish to improve upon in piecemeal fashion, possibly because they\\u2019re not the ones being chewed up and spit out by it, or even neglected by it entirely.<\\/p>\\n<p>However, even if all of the above is clearly understood, there is one absolutely vital thing remaining to understand about <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> that cannot be replicated in any other way, by any other means. Because <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> lacks conditions and is paid regardless of work, it provides recipients the power to refuse to work. This is the real fear of those who worry a <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> will result in people working less, but it is also its greatest strength.<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>The ability to say no to an employer provides people the bargaining power and the choice to determine how they work, where they work, for how much and for how long. No other policy does that. A minimum wage certainly doesn\\u2019t. Wage subsidies certainly don\\u2019t. Without <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span>, the labor market is coercive, and that means people accept what they can get. With <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span>, wages for low-demand jobs must go up and\\/or hours must go down in order to attract people with incomes independent of work to do them, or those same jobs must be automated to be performed by machines instead, whichever is cheaper.<\\/p>\\n<p>A <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> is most simply a minimum <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">floor<\\/span>. It\\u2019s a new starting point above the poverty level instead of below it. There will still be jobs for people to earn additional <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> and those jobs can pay more if people hate doing them. Additionally, considering a potential future where there&#8217;s half as much employment, that also means just as many can be employed if we all work half as much so as to better share the remaining employment. And with the increased bargaining power\\u00a0<span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> provides, that can also mean getting paid more for less work.<\\/p>\\n<p><span class=\\\"il\\\">Basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> is not some regressive conspiracy of the Silicon Valley elite to create a neo-serfdom where the entire population only earns a maximum of $12,000 per year. That is the exact opposite of how it works. With <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span>, $12,000 becomes the new absolute minimum for everyone and no one is a serf because everyone&#8217;s <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic<\\/span> needs are covered. Poverty is eliminated. Inequality is reduced.<\\/p>\\n<p>Additionally, everyone is free to earn any additional <span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span>, and on their terms. For the first time, everyone will have the individual negotiating power to dictate terms to employers that must be met. People who have this fundamental power are those who can then make further desired changes in the economy, in their businesses, in their governments and in their lives.<\\/p>\\n<p>So you tell me. Would you prefer conditional <span class=\\\"il\\\">welfare<\\/span> nets or would you prefer an unconditional <span class=\\\"il\\\">basic\\u00a0<\\/span><span class=\\\"il\\\">income<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">floor<\\/span>? Because one of these options is a relic of history, and the other is a road to the future.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>It appears some establishment voices have picked up on a way of opposing the idea of the monthly citizen dividend of about $1,000 per month, known as universal basic income (UBI), in a way that successfully leaves some progressively minded people afraid. <\\/p>\\n\"},\"author\":321129,\"featured_media\":1382176,\"comment_status\":\"open\",\"ping_status\":\"closed\",\"sticky\":false,\"format\":\"standard\",\"categories\":[25515,15986864,17396],\"tags\":[9379,449553172,419271376,449553171],\"_links\":{\"self\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/posts\\/1380149\"}],\"collection\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/posts\"}],\"about\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/types\\/post\"}],\"author\":[{\"embeddable\":true,\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/users\\/321129\"}],\"replies\":[{\"embeddable\":true,\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/comments?post=1380149\"}],\"version-history\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/posts\\/1380149\\/revisions\"}],\"https:\\/\\/api.w.org\\/featuredmedia\":[{\"embeddable\":true,\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/media\\/1382176\"}],\"https:\\/\\/api.w.org\\/attachment\":[{\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/media?parent=1380149\"}],\"https:\\/\\/api.w.org\\/term\":[{\"taxonomy\":\"category\",\"embeddable\":true,\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/categories?post=1380149\"},{\"taxonomy\":\"post_tag\",\"embeddable\":true,\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/tags?post=1380149\"}],\"https:\\/\\/api.w.org\\/meta\":[{\"embeddable\":true,\"href\":\"https:\\/\\/public-api.wordpress.com\\/wp\\/v2\\/sites\\/techcrunch.com\\/posts\\/1380149\\/meta\"}]}},{\"id\":1383084,\"date\":\"2016-09-09T16:57:03\",\"date_gmt\":\"2016-09-09T23:57:03\",\"guid\":{\"rendered\":\"http:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/?p=1383084\"},\"modified\":\"2016-09-09T16:57:03\",\"modified_gmt\":\"2016-09-09T23:57:03\",\"slug\":\"hack-for-the-environment-at-the-disrupt-sf-hackathon\",\"type\":\"post\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/09\\/09\\/hack-for-the-environment-at-the-disrupt-sf-hackathon\\/\",\"title\":{\"rendered\":\"Hack for the environment at the Disrupt SF&nbsp;Hackathon\"},\"content\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>This weekend, hundreds of developers and engineers\\u00a0will pack into the Disrupt SF conference space for our <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/event-info\\/disrupt-sf-2016\\/disrupt-sf-hackathon-2016\\/\\\">Hackathon<\\/a>, a 24-hour race to build a brand-new product.

The Net Zero facility is a home in Maryland that NIST has transformed into a laboratory for conducting research on energy efficiency. The four-bedroom house produces all of its own energy, with some to spare, sending the excess back to the electrical grid. It&#8217;s a model for the American home of the future, and it produces valuable data on energy use and production that developers can use to create new energy-efficient products.<\\/p>\\n<p>The data comes to us from the Department of Commerce, which touts itself as America&#8217;s data agency.

For instance, many Americans do not know that a clothes dryer consumes more energy than almost any other appliance in the home. With this information, individuals could make decisions that reduce the amount of energy they use and lower their energy costs,&#8221; Pritzker said. &#8220;We are also interested in the creation of an algorithm that predicts energy production from the home\\u2019s solar panels. This type of information could be used as the basis for predicting energy production under various environmental conditions.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The market for these products is already enormous and is growing larger every day.\\u00a0In December, the United States and every other member of the\\u00a0United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

We sat down with Young to get the scoop on what the transaction means for the future of McAfee and how the company will be challenged in the coming months to navigate a separation from Intel and find its stride in a rapidly changing cybersecurity ecosystem.<\\/p>\\n<h2>The history<\\/h2>\\n<p>McAfee was founded in 1987 by yoga aficionado\\u00a0and reported <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/John_McAfee\\\">real-life Narcos character <\\/a>John McAfee.\\u00a0Some years later, in 2011, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2010\\/08\\/19\\/intel-buys-cyber-security-giant-mcafee-for-7-68-billion-in-cash\\/\\\">chip giant Intel purchased McAfee for $7.68 billion<\\/a>. The transaction was critical in that it tilted the company&#8217;s focus toward the hardware layer.<\\/p>\\n<p>This transaction was heavily criticized, but Intel remained bullish that McAfee would support\\u00a0the company&#8217;s growth into chip-level security solutions. DeepDefender, a tool for detecting and removing rootkits, became the key product of the acquisition. It\\u00a0leveraged a priority load position to do its work, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/kc.mcafee.com\\/corporate\\/index?page=content&amp;id=KB83825\\\">but ultimately was discontinued by the company in early 2015.<\\/a> McAfee, renamed the Intel Security Group by this point, continued to report growth, but never really met expectations from investors who patiently waited five years for a revolutionary new Intel security product that never came.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Shifting toward consumer IoT and full-service enterprise security<\\/h2>\\n<p>Wednesday&#8217;s announcement marks a significant turning point in McAfee&#8217;s history, away from chip-level innovation toward securing the Internet of Things for consumers and consolidating the number of cybersecurity companies enterprises have\\u00a0to work with.<br \\/>\\n<img class=\\\" wp-image-1382981 alignright\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/unnamed2.jpg?w=372&#038;h=557\\\" alt=\\\"Chris Young\\\" width=\\\"372\\\" height=\\\"557\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>While Intel will still own 49 percent of McAfee, Young says the company shouldn&#8217;t be seen as half chip company. Young and his investors from TPG, which own 51 percent of the company, have a plan for the future that involves riding that trend of service consolidation by enterprise customers. It&#8217;s common for large Fortune 500 companies to have security teams that work with dozens of cybersecurity providers for a slew of niche needs. Young explains that this creates accountability issues and communication problems when a company needs to respond to a hack.<\\/p>\\n<p>McAfee wants to partner and buy its way to the top of the cybersecurity food chain to establish itself as a force within the industry that can connect the growing number of startups in the space via the central McAfee platform. The plan is incredibly ambitious for a company that is\\u00a0on Day Two\\u00a0of finding its identify separate from Intel. Young believes that capital from TPG will enable McAfee to acquire security companies more broadly that may not have fit in with the initial Intel vision.<\\/p>\\n<p>McAfee still has offices co-located with Intel, but will be moving offsite in the future. Amidst all the change, employees have been anxious about what they are expected to do during the transition. Despite lofty goals, Young is instructing\\u00a0employees to &#8220;just keep doing what they have been doing.&#8221;\\u00a0A transaction of such large\\u00a0magnitude is more than enough to keep him\\u00a0busy ironing out financial details and establishing the organizational structure, leadership and vision for the company.<\\/p>\\n<p>When the dust settles, and Young has forged a company identity, McAfee will focus on securing enterprise data centers. He\\u00a0also wants the company\\u00a0to continue working with device manufacturers and service providers to bolster the security\\u00a0of things we use every day, like\\u00a0cloud storage, communication and file sharing.<\\/p>\\n<p>For consumers, focus will remain on offering a one-stop shop for simplifying security. McAfee&#8217;s enterprise division is larger than its consumer division, but not by much. Users should be able to purchase\\u00a0a single security solution that can evolve and remain device-agnostic. This is what sets McAfee apart from device manufacturers that secure their own devices, says Young. And while the Internet of Things has been mostly underwhelming to date, McAfee will be further developing partnerships to put an end to vulnerabilities on the accessories we use with our core devices.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>[tc_dropcap]With Intel set to spin off its security unit\\u00a0into a\\u00a0reincarnation of McAfee, attention is quickly turning to Chris Young, the guy tasked with steering\\u00a0the security ship through tumultuous waters and back toward relative independence.[\\/tc_dropcap] Young has been running Intel&#8217;s\\u00a0Security Group for quite some time now as senior vice president and general manager.

The first bots built by outside developers back in April were clumsy and more trouble than just using a website. So Facebook&#8217;s Creative Shop is getting involved, working with bot maker Msg.ai and the Tommy Hilfiger fashion brand to make a flagship chatbot worthy to point to.<\\/p>\\n<p>The TMY.GRL A.I. Messenger Bot will promote today&#8217;s debut of <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/global.tommy.com\\/int\\/en\\/collections\\/tommy-x-gigi\\/14\\\">Tommy&#8217;s capsule fashion line for supermodel and social media star Gigi Hadid<\\/a>. People can discover it by tapping the message button on Tommy&#8217;s Facebook page or posts, opening a shortlink URL or scanning its Messenger QR code.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1383010\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screen-shot-2016-09-09-at-2-17-02-pm.png?w=680&#038;h=367\\\" alt=\\\"screen-shot-2016-09-09-at-2-17-02-pm\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"367\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>Through the bot, fashionistas can type questions or select pre-made queries to learn about Gigi, see behind-the-scenes content from the collection&#8217;s runway show event and, most importantly, shop for items from the nautical-themed clothing line.<\\/p>\\n<p>Facebook still hasn&#8217;t built a native checkout and payment flow into its Messenger bot platform. Shoppers will be linked out to Tommy Hilfiger&#8217;s website to put in their credit card details and confirm purchases. While that might give brands a deeper sense of control over the experience, it likely also reduces conversion rates as leaving Messenger gives them a chance to get distracted or reconsider buying something. It&#8217;s something Facebook will hopefully build soon.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter wp-image-1383064 size-large\\\" style=\\\"border:1px solid #000000;\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/tommy-bot-screenshots.png?w=680&#038;h=399\\\" alt=\\\"tommy-bot-screenshots\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"399\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>I\\u00a0asked why the company is diving into the unproven world of bots, Tommy Hilfiger himself told me &#8220;We\\u2019re really focused on going directly to the consumer. We are obviously distributed in our own stores and in department stores, but going directly\\u00a0to the consumer is really part of the motive and the future of the omni-channel process.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Puneet Mehta, CEO of Msg.ai, explains that consumer goods companies are attracted to bots because of &#8220;the relationship aspect, not just sales.&#8221; If they can create a memorable, interactive experience with their brand instead of just one-way marketing, customers will keep coming back. That&#8217;s why Facebook&#8217;s marketing experts from its Creative Shop, which typically help out advertisers, got their hands dirty on developing this bot.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Botty Hilfiger<\\/h2>\\n<p>How did a 31-year-old company come up with the idea for a chatbot? Hilfiger tells me it started with &#8220;a conversation I had with Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. We talked about innovative ways to enhance the shopping experience. We\\u2019re always a bit ahead of the curve.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1383031\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/tommyxgigi.png?w=680&#038;h=340\\\" alt=\\\"tommyxgigi\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"340\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>Chasing new technologies hasn&#8217;t always panned out. While Tommy Hilfiger&#8217;s Instagram and Snapchat strategies have been a success, 25 years ago it unsuccessfully tried to build touch-screen vending machines. Hilfiger explains that &#8220;We had lots of trials and tribulations with that. The credit card system was working, the touch-screen heated up.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>But now he feels that by relying on a dependable company like Facebook, there&#8217;s less to worry about and more to gain as customers\\u00a0embrace new ways to shop.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignright wp-image-1383019\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screen-shot-2016-09-09-at-2-17-26-pm.png?w=320&#038;h=317\\\" alt=\\\"screen-shot-2016-09-09-at-2-17-26-pm\\\" width=\\\"320\\\" height=\\\"317\\\" \\/>Tommy Hilfiger CMO Avery Baker tells me that &#8220;one of the things that&#8217;s always been important in fashion is customer service and the experience in a store.&#8221; The\\u00a0TMY.GRL A.I. Messenger Bot will try to answer people&#8217;s questions and offer a more immersive, responsive feel than shoppers usually get online.<\\/p>\\n<p>The bot will try to capture some of the personality of talking to Gigi herself, while remaining transparent that there&#8217;s not a human on the other end. &#8220;No one wants to feel like they&#8217;re being spoken to by the corporate animal,&#8221; Baker admits.<\\/p>\\n<p>Fashion still seems like an unlikely candidate for chatbot success. People can&#8217;t touch or try on the clothes, and the bot doesn&#8217;t know enough about the user&#8217;s style to make smart recommendations about which items they might prefer.<\\/p>\\n<p>But Hilfiger believes this brand-specific bot could perform better than multi-brand retail shopping bots like Spring, which launched with the Messenger bot platform and was quickly proven confusing and unconvincing.<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1383029\\\" style=\\\"width: 690px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-1383029 size-large\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/tommy.jpg?w=680&#038;h=462\\\" alt=\\\"tommy\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"462\\\" \\/><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Tommy Hilfiger (center)<\\/p><\\/div>\\n<p>&#8220;I think if you\\u2019re an established brand and the consumer is familiar with the brand, they have confidence that that certain cotton or cashmere or denim is the quality that would be acceptable, that they would be confident that the fit would be okay,&#8221; Hilfiger concludes. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of different reasons why people shop online. Now they can receive shipments, try on items, and send back what they don\\u2019t accept. They don\\u2019t necessarily need to touch and feel.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>At the very least, Tommy Hilfiger could use the campaign to lure people into messaging their bot first. That&#8217;s critical, since Facebook Messenger only lets brands message people who&#8217;ve already pinged them. Getting conversations started is essentially the new version of getting people to Like your Facebook Page.

The pressure to conquer <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span> stemmed from the threat of progress by foreign nations, and, consequently, an ideology. But when government involvement in <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span> increased in such countries as the United States in the 1980s, so too did the unexpected accidents and disasters.<\\/p>\\n<p>The need for diversification as a means to mitigate technology-related risk ultimately served as an important catalyst to slowly open up the world of <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span> to private enterprise. As an example, the Challenger accident in 1986 forced the Department of Defense to look for alternatives to the <span class=\\\"il\\\">Space<\\/span> Shuttle.

Their progress to date has generated a significant amount of enthusiasm among the masses for a fresh set of safe and sustainable methods of transportation to the cosmos. And wherever there\\u2019s enthusiasm, there\\u2019s also interest from sources of private investment capital. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.cbinsights.com\\/blog\\/space-and-ar-vr-drive-frontier-tech\\/\\\">As reported by CB Insights<\\/a>, VCs are paying more attention to technology startups that are accelerating the commercialization of <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span>.<\\/p>\\n<p>In 2015, VC investment in the sector increased by 253 percent year-over-year, and a whopping 2,052 percent since 2012.

This reality will make the <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span> economy as accessible as any other on Earth several decades down the road.

In 2015,\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.cbinsights.com\\/research-venture-capital-2015\\\">approximately $129 billion in VC funding was deployed globally across 7,872 deals<\\/a>. Of this total, just over $2 billion was deployed to <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span>-based companies across 44 deals. This makes sense, as the typical investment horizon for a VC is 7 to 10 years.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;left&#8221;]Space commercialization is here to stay despite the challenges and obvious roadblocks.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p><span class=\\\"il\\\">Space<\\/span>-based enterprises represent much longer investment horizons with a far greater risk of failure. And, naturally, without the necessary seed or growth-stage capital, it becomes very difficult for any entrepreneur to run a successful <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span>-based private enterprise. As such, building a <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span>-based business has largely been within the realm of successful tech billionaires.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Access to insurance<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>There also is a lack of adequate and secured insurance, which is because of the inability of insurers to see and test the reliability of\\u00a0<span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span>-based technologies in the recent past.

Two decades ago, the commercial satellite business was expected to achieve independence within a few years of being established, but government involvement is still needed to this day to see projects to the execution phase. It can be argued that this was previously due to a lack of capital from private markets, as well as a lack of information available about <span class=\\\"il\\\">space\\u00a0<\\/span>commercialization within the public sphere. Luckily, these barriers are becoming less of an issue over time as the private sector absorbs the know-how that currently resides within the public sector.<\\/p>\\n<p>In terms of risks overall, <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span> entrepreneurs still need to prove they are up for the tasks related to <span class=\\\"il\\\">commercializing<\\/span> <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span>. Many fear that lives will be lost because proper precautions will not be taken. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/spacenews.com\\/34735new-mexico-expands-spaceflight-liability-law\\/\\\">Given the laws in New Mexico regarding limited liability rights for corporations engaged in making <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span> accessible for citizens<\\/a>, these concerns are not totally unfounded. After all, if something goes wrong in <span class=\\\"il\\\">space<\\/span>, whose fault is it? And in the case of an international incident, which country\\u2019s laws apply? These are important questions.<\\/p>\\n<h2>The verdict<\\/h2>\\n<p><span class=\\\"il\\\">Space<\\/span> commercialization is here to stay despite the <span class=\\\"il\\\">challenges<\\/span> and obvious roadblocks.

Zeekit will then overlay those items on your body using the size you choose.<\\/p>\\n<p>So instead of\\u00a0mentally noting how a certain item would look on you instead of that lanky model, you can see it in augmented reality and in your size.<\\/p>\\n<p>The brother-sister duo has used tech to connect with its audience at past shows, like drones and VR, and the latest experience is an outgrowth of what&#8217;s worked to bring in consumers.

Zeekit\\u00a0could help reduce headaches by more accurately predicting which size dress or slacks look best on your body.<\\/p>\\n<p>But Rebecca Minkoff&#8217;s show isn&#8217;t the only one integrating tech. Thanks to fashion bloggers and the rise of social media, items once kept close for months at a time by designers and fashion editors are readily available to see &#8212; and buy.<\\/p>\\n<p>More brands like Minkoff and Hilfiger are now selling items\\u00a0seen on the runway that day, and other lines like\\u00a0Noon by Noor, Band of Outsiders, Prabal Gurung and others have also hopped on the VR bandwagon to introduce the latest to armchair fashion fans, as well.<\\/p>\\n<p>But Uri says tech has also changed the habits of a younger generation of buyers. It&#8217;s an Instagram era, and young women are staging their own fashion shows now. We&#8217;re seeing more diversity in the industry and real women on magazines. They&#8217;re not buying if they think the fashion is made for lanky models and not them.<\\/p>\\n<p>Integration of VR and augmented reality apps like Zeekit\\u00a0enable real women to see themselves in the clothing, not just runway models, and Uri believes the app could help boost buyer confidence in his brand. It&#8217;s a way to make his line accessible to every woman, not just a five-foot-ten-inch, bone-thin model.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think that will then take away some of the elite nature and exclusivity that has been part of fashion and bring it to a more real place that will further spark interest in relatability,&#8221; Uri said.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Not only is augmented reality helping us capture all the Pok\\u00e9mon, it&#8217;s also made its way to Rebecca Minkoff&#8217;s fall preview show at Fashion Week this Saturday.

The platform crowdsources the creation of routes, aggregating desired pick-up and destination data from user interaction with its app and determining routes once interest in a particular one reaches a tipping point.

Here, you&#8217;ll see the new options to &#8220;Share Link&#8221; which gives you a URL you can send over email, messaging, or through any other means you prefer.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1382785\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/moments-joinable-launch-2screens.png?w=680&#038;h=538\\\" alt=\\\"moments-joinable-launch-2screens\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"538\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>This web support follows a move by Google Photos earlier this spring which <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/05\\/11\\/google-photos-takes-on-facebook-moments-with-improvements-to-shared-albums\\/\\\">added improvements to shared albums<\\/a> &#8211; notably, the ability for users to add their own photos to a shared album they received from a friend, as well as support for commenting. Facebook Moments, meanwhile, was still limited to private photo-sharing among Facebook friends at the time.<\\/p>\\n<p>The upgraded Moments application is rolling out another new feature, as well: support for full-resolution photos. While the app already will host all your photos for free, it wasn&#8217;t a true photo backup service as it would optimize those photos for mobile use.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1382787\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/moments-fav-full-res-white.png?w=680&#038;h=485\\\" alt=\\\"moments-fav-full-res-white\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"485\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>That changes a bit with the addition of a new &#8220;Favorites&#8221; tab in Moments. When you add a photo to your Favorites by clicking the star at the top-right corner within 30 days of uploading them or receiving them, it will then be saved in Moments in full resolution. There&#8217;s no limit on the number of photos you can favorite either, notes Facebook.<\\/p>\\n<p>This again, seems a direct response to Google Photos, which <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2015\\/05\\/28\\/google-photos-breaks-free-of-google-now-offers-free-unlimited-storage\\/\\\">launched<\\/a> with free, unlimited photo storage plus\\u00a0the option to choose a different plan where you can save full-res photos to your Google Storage. The difference is that Google Photos requires you to pay\\u00a0for the additional storage you need beyond<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/support.google.com\\/drive\\/answer\\/2375123?hl=en\\\"> the 15 GB it offers for free<\\/a>, which is also shared across Google Drive and Gmail.<\\/p>\\n<p>Facebook, instead, is requiring you pick-and-choose which photos deserve to be saved in full-res &#8211; likely knowing that the manual labor involved with starring each photo will cut down on people\\u00a0uploading entire albums at the\\u00a0original resolution. Of course, Moments is still not an alternative to a full photo backup service, but it could be a cheaper option than Google Photos if you&#8217;re one of those people who is already close to maxing out your free storage, due to heavy Gmail or Google Drive use.<\\/p>\\n<p>The updated app is live on the <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/itunes.apple.com\\/app\\/id991346515\\\">iTunes App Store<\\/a> and <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/play.google.com\\/store\\/apps\\/details?id=com.facebook.moments\\\">Google Play<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Facebook Moments, the company&#8217;s private photo-sharing application which took the place of mobile photo sync late last year,\\u00a0is now expanding beyond the confines of your mobile phone and your personal network.

To be clear, this coordination only works because everyone agrees to it voluntarily\\u00a0&#8212;\\u00a0and if the <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span> insists on inserting itself, those using the function could agree to do things another way.<\\/p>\\n<p>In fact, in a reversal from the stereotype of a bureaucracy seeking ever-expanding power, the government agency that would be tasked with this role agrees that the plan to implement the functions without the <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span> government would work just fine. Unfortunately, those advancing arguments for <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span> involvement demonstrate fundamental misunderstandings about how the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span> works. Indeed, continued <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span> government involvement in this function makes it more likely, <span class=\\\"il\\\">not<\\/span> less, that the outcomes critics seek to avoid\\u00a0&#8212;\\u00a0including interference by foreign government in the operation of the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet &#8212;\\u00a0<\\/span>would come to pass.<\\/p>\\n<p>Since 1998, the <span class=\\\"il\\\">Internet<\\/span> Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has performed a critical but basically clerical job for the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span>: the IANA functions. The <span class=\\\"il\\\">Internet<\\/span> Assigned Numbers Authority (or IANA) is a little like a land registry for the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span>: It performs a critical function because keeping the registry up to date and available is important, but it is also basically a clerical job because all the policy decisions are made by someone else.<\\/p>\\n<p>Historically, ICANN has performed the IANA functions under a contract with the <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span> Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). It was always the intention, from the founding of ICANN, for that contract to fade away as the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span> community developed oversight mechanisms that could replace NTIA\\u2019s role.<\\/p>\\n<p>The people on the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span> who set the policies for the various IANA registries have come up with those oversight mechanisms. Accordingly, NTIA has announced that it intends to let the current contract with ICANN expire at the end of September. If that happens, then starting in October, the stewardship of the IANA functions will be performed just like everything else on the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span>: through collaboration of the interested parties (most of whom are from the private sector).<\\/p>\\n<p>This is a clear example of a government program that worked. The conditions for success were laid out, and they were met &#8212; and now the government can step out of the way and allow the private sector to keep up the pace of innovation on the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span>.<\\/p>\\n<p>It is particularly dangerous to suggest that maintaining the <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span>\\u00a0government\\u2019s role in IANA will prevent attempts by foreign governments to interfere with the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span>. On the contrary, the best way to encourage interference is for the <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span> to refuse to complete a transition that was first discussed when the founder of Facebook was 14 years old.\\u00a0<span class=\\\"il\\\">Over<\\/span> the past two years, people from all <span class=\\\"il\\\">over<\\/span> the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span> have been working on nailing down the details of this stewardship transition.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;right&#8221;]The system works and is stable today because the various actors can be relied upon to do what they say.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>If the <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span>\\u00a0government pulls the rug out from under all that work at the last minute, it will encourage foreign governments\\u2019 claims that the <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span> really does have control. It will inspire them to renew calls to move IANA stewardship to the United Nations or some other intergovernmental forum. Instead of enacting the current plan, which will be invisible to practically every person on the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span>, reasserting <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span>\\u00a0government authority will make the i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span> an international political football.<\\/p>\\n<p>And the truth is that the <span class=\\\"il\\\">U.S.<\\/span>\\u00a0government does <span class=\\\"il\\\">not<\\/span> have control anyway. The i<span class=\\\"il\\\">nternet<\\/span> is a voluntary system: In a network of networks, there is no center of control because there is no center. The only thing that works is positive incentives to do the right thing in your enlightened self-interest. People use IANA today because it is convenient to do so. Make it inconvenient, and you set up the conditions by which people turn to some other mechanism.<\\/p>\\n<p>So, any reassertion of <span class=\\\"il\\\" style=\\\"line-height:1.625;\\\">U.S.<\\/span><span style=\\\"line-height:1.625;\\\">\\u00a0government power depends on a fantasy that the <\\/span><span class=\\\"il\\\" style=\\\"line-height:1.625;\\\">U.S. government actually can assert that power.

If one party (such as the\\u00a0<\\/span>U.S.<span style=\\\"line-height:1.625;\\\">\\u00a0government) changes its mind with no technical justification, everyone else will need to think twice about what that party will do in other cases. Such mistrust would introduce much bigger changes than merely letting the IANA contract expire, as it is set to do.<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p>We have a good plan for stewardship of the IANA functions.

When blog\\u00a0visitors click one of these new links, they&#8217;re taken to a merchant&#8217;s website, where they may then make a purchase. In that case, Tumblr will show up as the referrer and then receive the commission.<\\/p>\\n<p>Typically, when VigLink is involved in handling the rollout of affiliate links, it takes a cut of the commissions the publisher would earn, with 75% of the commission going to the publisher, and the rest kept for\\u00a0itself. However, that split can vary based on things like the traffic type and size of the network, so Tumblr may have gotten a better deal.<\\/p>\\n<p>For most Tumblr users, the change will likely go unnoticed &#8211; affiliate links still redirect the visitor to the same landing page. And in the case that VigLink fails to respond, Tumblr will simply forward the visitor on without an affiliate code. Meanwhile, Tumblr says it will be tracking response times to make sure that the implementation of the new links doesn&#8217;t slow down its service.<\\/p>\\n<p>The addition of affiliate links comes at a time when Yahoo\\u00a0is trying to squeeze more money from the blogging service it <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/qz.com\\/608497\\/yahoo-just-admitted-it-badly-overpaid-for-tumblr\\/\\\">overpaid<\\/a> for in <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2013\\/05\\/20\\/its-official-yahoo-is-buying-tumblr-for-1-1b-promises-to-keep-it-independent\\/\\\">a $1.1 billion acquisition deal in 2013.\\u00a0<\\/a>In a call with investors this February, Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman said\\u00a0Yahoo wrote down Tumblr by $230 million.

And fair play to them.\\u00a0In February last year the Pi had racked up <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2015\\/02\\/17\\/raspberry-pi-sales-pass-5-million\\/\\\">5 million unit sales<\\/a>.

So the market for Pi will surely accommodate a premium bundle likely to\\u00a0appeal to\\u00a0gizmo lovers\\u00a0in the Western world, while continuing to\\u00a0support expanding access to computing in developing markets via the Foundation&#8217;s\\u00a0most affordable Pis.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Foundation is\\u00a0by no means the first to offer a Pi starter kit. Indeed, the lack of an official kit provided a window of opportunity for third parties\\u00a0to put together Pi bundles of their own, such as London-based startup <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2015\\/05\\/04\\/kano-series-a\\/\\\">Kano which offers a bundle aimed at kids<\\/a> that includes not just hardware bits but its own software skin\\u00a0running atop the Pi&#8217;s OS with gamified elements.

The company spent a good deal of its time today with the\\u00a0audience of seasoned\\u00a0auto reporters and, alternatively, myself, dissecting exactly what the buyer of its\\u00a0$130k Revero looked like.<\\/p>\\n<p>Spoiler alert: really rich.<\\/p>\\n<p>Karma executives admitted\\u00a0that this vehicle did not have\\u00a0universal\\u00a0appeal by any means, and furthermore that the total\\u00a0consumer\\u00a0market they were targeting was perhaps only 200-300 thousand people in size. These owners are people with at least a couple other luxury cars in their garage who want a car that turns heads while being a blast to drive.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1382635\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screen-shot-2016-09-08-at-8-49-51-pm.png?w=738&#038;h=490\\\" alt=\\\"screen-shot-2016-09-08-at-8-49-51-pm\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"490\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>The execs\\u00a0spent a good deal of time in its presentation alluding to\\u00a0how the 2012 Fisker Karma, like a beautiful woman, was timeless and needed only new dressings and jewelry to attract the gazes of its (primarily male) buyers.\\u00a0This didn&#8217;t stop throughout the presentation as title slides showing off new UI bells and whistles were actually labeled things like &#8220;new jewelry.&#8221; The comparisons\\u00a0from the fleet of male executives seemed a bit\\u00a0tone deaf, but to be fair, at one point an exec also compared the vehicle\\u00a0to Brad Pitt so maybe they all just really want to bang\\u00a0this car.<\\/p>\\n<p>Like a beautiful Brad Pitt, the Revero&#8217;s looks haven&#8217;t changed a ton from\\u00a02012, just a few nips and tucks here and there. The &#8220;moustache&#8221; grille has received some slight alterations and just below them the body of the car has received some more slight alterations to the unique\\u00a0diamond-shaped vents.<\\/p>\\n<p>All-in-all it really still is a stunning design.<\\/p>\\n<p>On the more technical side, this vehicle has a 260-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine from GM and boast a\\u00a021.4 kWh battery that gives the electric hybrid\\u00a0about 50 miles of range. The most significant\\u00a0spec improvement from a performance standpoint seems to be its Sport Mode 0-60 time, which has dropped a second to 5.4 seconds.<\\/p>\\n<p>For Revero buyers, the electric hybrid seems more about embracing trends in connectivity and efficiency without having to dive head-first into the cult of Tesla in what luxury buyers\\u00a0might see more as a political statement than a personal statement.<\\/p>\\n<p>Karma Chief Revenue Officer Jim Taylor described the very conscientious\\u00a0moves to stress\\u00a0the image of the Revero as a\\u00a0relaxed driving car over being\\u00a0a technical device. He described how many Fisker owners\\u00a0saw the Tesla as &#8220;an iPad on wheels,&#8221; and prioritized choosing\\u00a0a vehicle\\u00a0with the feel of a supercar alongside\\u00a0some hybrid benefits, rather than the other way around.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1382636\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screen-shot-2016-09-08-at-8-50-01-pm.png?w=738&#038;h=491\\\" alt=\\\"screen-shot-2016-09-08-at-8-50-01-pm\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"491\\\" \\/>The Revero&#8217;s status as an electric hybrid largely seems to be merely an added perk to owners, attaching an\\u00a0image of innovation to the vehicle&#8217;s much more important signature luxury design.<\\/p>\\n<p>Case in point is\\u00a0the Revero&#8217;s solar roof panel, which, for all its prettiness is much more about the image it conjures than the performance it brings. The solar roof\\u00a0is capable of adding up to 1.5 miles of drive distance to the battery, which frankly isn&#8217;t a ton considering the fanfare directed towards the feature.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-tc-article-featured-image-wide wp-image-1382634\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/ciu_energy_flow.png?w=738&#038;h=461\\\" alt=\\\"ciu_energy_flow\\\" width=\\\"738\\\" height=\\\"461\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>Karma has gone to greater lengths to ensure that the connectivity of the car adheres more to the lifestyle of its owners. The vehicle will have CarPlay integration at launch with Android Auto support coming later. The dashboard &#8220;infotainment&#8221; UI has been completely revamped based on a design drawing influence from diamonds and stuff in a package that is much more responsive and snappy than the 2012 Fisker Karma&#8217;s sluggish central display.\\u00a0Over-the-air updates will deliver\\u00a0upgrades to the infotainment system as well as the overall vehicle firmware.<\\/p>\\n<p>All of these features ultimately unite to create a car that\\u00a0doesn&#8217;t appear to be a radical upgrade from the 2012 Fisker Karma, but is instead more of a declaration of Karma&#8217;s renewed staying power as a luxury car brand under new ownership.<\\/p>\\n<p>Notably, the company\\u00a0seems to have legitimately no idea when this car will be ready to ship, saying that they&#8217;re taking their time to perfect the vehicle.

The couple are the youngest to agree to the Giving Pledge, an initiative by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that asks billionaires to give away most of their wealth to charity.

Campaign finance is new to Tuna and Moskovitz, but a bitter campaign cycle inspired them to branch out.<\\/p>\\n<p>The election, Moskovitz wrote, &#8220;has become a referendum on who we want to be \\u2014 as individuals, as a nation and as a society. Will we be driven by fear, towards tribalism, emphasizing the things that divide us? Will we focus on how to advantage those most similar to us while building barriers to separate us from the rest of the world?&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The $20 million donation puts Moskovitz and Tuna in the ranks of mega-donors like Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager who has reportedly put over <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.washingtontimes.com\\/news\\/2016\\/jul\\/27\\/tom-steyer-democrat-donor-wields-influence-at-conv\\/\\\">$31.5 million<\\/a> into this year&#8217;s campaign.

It was a simply a clear comparison between Apple Watch sales and sales of traditional watch brands, both high and low. And it wasn&#8217;t good.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the bottom of the barrel was Japan&#8217;s Casio, makers of heavy-duty watches designed to take on tank treads and falls from your dresser. Further up the list was Longines, a mid-level brand with a long and storied history. Then Patek Philippe under Citizen and Seiko. Near the top was Fossil, the brand most of us get for high school graduation. Then the Apple Watch. Then Rolex.<\\/p>\\n<p>This list, when read with a watch lover&#8217;s eye, is an outrage. It&#8217;s like showing a list of car brands &#8211; Toyota, Bugatti, Ford, Mercedes &#8211; and ranking them by sales, not quality. The list would be an affront. To the watch lover &#8211; and the brands that cater to them &#8211; none of these upstarts, the Casio&#8217;s, the Citizens &#8211; deserve to be on the same slide as Patek Philippe and Rolex. Omega and Cartier &#8211; mid-level brands &#8211; maybe, but not those patresfamilias of the watch industry.<\\/p>\\n<p>But there they are. And that&#8217;s exactly why Swiss watchmaking is doomed. And that&#8217;s why more and more smaller brands are appearing to fill the yawning chasm between affordable and ludicrous.<\\/p>\\n<p>First we must understand that the watch industry is about glamour. Watches have a deep and important history and are some of the most beautiful and well-designed objects of our era. But they are also just jewelry, and expensive jewelry at that. Watch makers have built a wide network of retail &#8220;doors&#8221; and they created artificial scarcity by making those doors take &#8211; not choose &#8211; product of the brand&#8217;s choosing. Regional manager didn&#8217;t like your store in Pittsburgh? He&#8217;d make you buy ten middling watches, a few expensive but unusable bands, and maybe a few good pieces. Then retailers mark them down, give discounts to favorite customers, and place orders for &#8220;grail watches&#8221; that wouldn&#8217;t be filled for months or years. The Swiss watch industry, during the 1980s and 1990s even into the 2000s was in firm control of its inventory, retail sales, and profits. And times were good.<\\/p>\\n<p>Now watches are a commodity. Companies like Daniel Wellington and MVMT are selling millions of dollars worth of acceptable if poorly-constructed watches &#8211; thereby gutting the Swiss low-end &#8211; and with advanced manufacturing techniques we are seeing smaller brands produce mechanical timepieces. Glitzy houses like MB&amp;F and more staid, traditional places like F.P. Journe &#8211; companies who make beautiful watches for the sake of their beauty and complexity &#8211; may make it out of this maelstrom but only in the same way vinyl producers have found a small niche with music lovers.<\\/p>\\n<p>Don&#8217;t believe me? Check out this report <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fhs.ch\\/file\\/59\\/comm_160707_a.pdf\\\">from the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;July was not a strong month for Swiss watch industry exports,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;The fact that there were two fewer working days this year certainly penalised the results to some extent, but that was not the determining factor because at the same time Swiss exports were higher overall. The industry saw the value of its exports lose 14.2% compared to July 2015 at 1.6 billion francs.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The media is piling on. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.cnbc.com\\/2016\\/08\\/23\\/swiss-watch-sales-are-on-a-losing-run.html\\\">CNBC writes<\\/a> &#8220;Is time being called on the watch industry as a reliable source of income for Switzerland?&#8221;<br \\/>\\n<img class=\\\"alignright size-full wp-image-1382621\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screen-shot-2016-09-09-at-9-54-45-am.png?w=1024&#038;h=201\\\" alt=\\\"screen-shot-2016-09-09-at-9-54-45-am\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"201\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>It gives me no pleasure in stating any of this except for a small surge of schadenfreude: barring some miracle this line will fall and fall. In short, their hubris did them in.<\\/p>\\n<p>Many would claim Tim Cook&#8217;s slide is bogus. Rolex doesn&#8217;t publish sales numbers but we can estimate the company is making and selling about a million watches a year making it hardly the rarified brand that most watch neophytes think it is. If Rolex is the brand to beat, and you can be certain they want you to think so, then in a few months Apple will beat it handily.<\\/p>\\n<p>Why? Because people don&#8217;t <i>need<\\/i> watches but Apple understands why they <i>want<\\/i> them. Quality workmanship is the first leg on Apple&#8217;s little watchmaking stool followed by a wide range of well-made accessories. Functionality is the third leg. Can your Rolex tell you the temperature in Cupertino? You may not care on a daily basis but if you&#8217;re about to take a red-eye an Apple Watch is far better than a Rolex at telling you whether to bring a coat.<\\/p>\\n<p>As I&#8217;ve said again and again, watchmakers brought this upon themselves. To create an air of exclusivity they jacked up prices and created artificial shortages. They ignored the Internet until it was far too late and ignored their true market &#8211; the watch obsessives who visit sites like <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ablogtowatch.com\\\">ABlogToWatch<\\/a> and <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.hodinkee.com\\\">Hodinkee<\\/a> and post wrist shots on <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/watches\\\">Reddit<\\/a>. Samsung even brought on, in its own, ham-handed way, an editor from <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/08\\/31\\/aw-kward\\/\\\">one of those sites<\\/a> in order to steal some of the panache from the Swiss brands. Sadly, if things keep heading this way the only things those obsessive sites will write about are Samsung and Apple smartwatches.<\\/p>\\n<p>The thing that really hurts? The Glycine Airman was once the watch to wear pilots in the early 20th century. It had a 24-hour dial and could tell two timezones at once. The Airman rode on the wrists of airline captains and helicopter pilots and there some examples so worn by use and abuse &#8211; yet still ticking &#8211; that you wonder how they survived. The watch had a story.<\\/p>\\n<p>Last month Invicta &#8211; a brand more at home on QVC than in anyone&#8217;s collection &#8211; <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ablogtowatch.com\\/invicta-acquires-glycine-watches\\/\\\">bought Glycine<\\/a>.

In the future, for example, bots, and AI in general, will help you make money off your checking account.<\\/p>\\n<p>Did you know that extra cash in your checking account is a missed opportunity? Every day, it loses value to inflation. To generate better returns, you could keep the bare minimum in your checking account and invest the rest. However, unexpected expenses can drain your account suddenly. Without extra cushioning in your checking account, you risk getting slapped with bank fees or credit card debt that quickly cancel out any gains from your investments.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;right&#8221;]AI will enable us to increase our wealth while decreasing our anxiety.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>It feels like you can\\u2019t win. Either you\\u2019re missing out on capital gains, or you\\u2019re playing limbo with your account balance. AI will make this struggle a thing of the past.<\\/p>\\n<p>Advances in AI will create a robo-accountant that knows your spending better than you do. By analyzing your purchase history, it will constantly move money between your checking, savings, investments and credit cards. This way, your checking account\\u2019s balance is always in the narrow \\u201csweet spot:\\u201d high enough to avoid fees, but not so high that you miss out on investment yield.<\\/p>\\n<p>Right now, finding that sweet spot is time-consuming and anxiety-inducing. In time, the robo-accountant will know when you\\u2019re likely to splurge. It will know when your car will need a repair, when your electric bill will spike. It will know when you\\u2019re actually better off carrying a balance on your credit card than paying your bank\\u2019s minimum-balance fee.<\\/p>\\n<p>A fee-minimizer\\/yield-optimizer could exist without AI, but it wouldn\\u2019t work that well. AI incorporates the ability to make complex judgments based on your history of spending habits, the fees from your various financial institutions and countless other factors. This is the crucial link that makes the product useful: It plans ahead so you don\\u2019t have to.<\\/p>\\n<p>Your robo-accountant will take everything into consideration to make sure you get the most yield from your money while minimizing the fees you pay across the board.

Because they eschewed traditional investors in favor of a series of\\u00a0Kickstarter campaigns, I decided to take a closer look at how the team makes\\u00a0it work.<\\/p>\\n<p>There are a few companies that have built successful businesses\\u00a0around repeat Kickstarter performances. Pebble, for example, has come a long way from its original <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.kickstarter.com\\/projects\\/597507018\\/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android\\\">$10 million Kickstarter campaign<\\/a>.

One of the biggest differences from its peers is that the company has chosen not to\\u00a0take external investment &#8212; and not for lack of offers.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I feel that if we take external investment, we would be letting the backers down to a degree,&#8221; says Peter Dering, the company&#8217;s founder. When pressed, he won&#8217;t say that the company won&#8217;t ever take investment, but the status quo is that he still owns 100 percent of the company, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to matter as much to him. The customers, though, that&#8217;s a different story. &#8220;It would be a bitter pill to swallow for some of our earliest backers. There are people who genuinely care and who know how special it is not to have investors.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1381955\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-1381955 img-full\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/capture-pro.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=684\\\" alt=\\\"Peter Dering, founder of Peak Design, with a mold for the company's Capture Pro product.

Wanting to have his camera available at all times, he was securing his camera to a strap on his backpack using a carabiner. It worked, but wasn&#8217;t ideal, and it got him thinking&#8230; shouldn&#8217;t there be a better way of carrying around a camera?<\\/p>\\n<p>The idea of having a camera tripod-compatible carrying clip came up, but there was a problem&#8230;<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_rr_crunchbase]&#8221;I spent six months designing the first prototype, made out of wood. My problem was that I didn&#8217;t know anyone who had brought a product to market before,&#8221; Dering says, admitting that he made things up as he went along.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;My breakthrough happened when I was traveling cross-country from California to New York. I was on a hike and met Dave Stoltz, who works as a machinist,&#8221; Dering tells me. The two got to talking, and &#8212; long story short &#8212; before long, Dering had his first metal prototype. &#8220;It just worked. It worked so much better than I could have ever dreamed of.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>With the first metal prototype done, a lot of the heavy lifting was done, but the product still needed to find a way to market somehow. Which was when a second coincidence struck home.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;The TikTok+LunaTik campaign raised just under a million dollars around the time that I was trying to figure out how to get the Capture Clip to market,&#8221; Dering says, referring <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.kickstarter.com\\/projects\\/1104350651\\/tiktok-lunatik-multi-touch-watch-kits\\/description\\\">to the late 2010 Kickstarter campaign<\\/a>\\u00a0for a product that turns an iPod Nano into a wearable. &#8220;It really moved the needle; three people told me about the campaign in the same week. It made me realize that Kickstarter was the missing piece of the puzzle.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The Capture Clip campaign\\u00a0was <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.kickstarter.com\\/projects\\/peak-design\\/capture-camera-clip-system\\/description\\\">launched in May of 2011 and raised $360,000<\\/a>\\u00a0&#8212; well above the $10,000 goal Dering was targeting.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t really look at the video anymore,&#8221; Dering laughs. &#8220;I made it in Windows MovieMaker 7&#8230; Let&#8217;s just say we&#8217;ve come a long way since then.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1381957\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-1381957 img-full\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/pdoffice-1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=492\\\" alt=\\\"Late-night design in progress at Peak Design's San Francisco office.\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"492\\\" \\/><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Late-night design in progress at Peak Design&#8217;s San Francisco office.<\\/p><\\/div>\\n<h2>Continuing the Kickstarter journey<\\/h2>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1381965\\\" style=\\\"width: 511px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-1381965\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/leash-and-cuff.png?w=501&#038;h=279\\\" alt=\\\"The Leash system introduced an innovative quick-release system for camera straps. \\\" width=\\\"501\\\" height=\\\"279\\\" \\/><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">The Leash system introduced an innovative quick-release system for camera straps.<\\/p><\\/div>\\n<p>When the idea came to do the second campaign, for the company&#8217;s second set of products, the <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.kickstarter.com\\/projects\\/peak-design\\/leash-by-peak-design\\\">Leash and Cuff<\\/a>, Peak Design&#8217;s team faced an interesting challenge.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the time, Dering felt the platform was firmly focused on independents, dreamers and people who wanted to create something new.

Nobody was willing to give us a definitive &#8216;yes,&#8217; but on the other hand, they didn&#8217;t give us a definitive &#8216;no&#8217; either. We were very hesitant to do the second campaign, but in the end we decided to go for it and see what happens.\\u00a0Kickstarter represented half of our revenue up to this point. It was 10 times more potent than any of our other selling techniques, and we needed the Kickstarter crowd&#8217;s help to get the product to market.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1381967\\\" style=\\\"width: 490px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignleft\\\"><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-1381967\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/quick-release-click.gif?w=480&#038;h=243\\\" alt=\\\"Click.

A full 20 percent of the Kickstarter video was dedicated to explaining why the company returned to Kickstarter a second time.<\\/p>\\n<p>The team needn&#8217;t have worried. Although it wasn&#8217;t as successful as its first campaign, the Leash and Cuff still raised a respectable chunk of cash in only 22 days &#8212; much shorter than its original 75-day campaign &#8211;with $216,000 pledged from more than 3,100 backers.\\u00a0Having found a successful formula, Dering slowly started hiring a team and continued running one Kickstarter campaign per year.<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1381959\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-1381959 img-full\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/peter-dering.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=542\\\" alt=\\\"Peter Dering.

Well, all of them except the tote bag. I guess I never really saw the point of a tote bag, but then, what do I know. The company has sold almost 1,800 of them as part of its Kickstarter campaign, netting a healthy $261,000 from that product alone.<\\/p>\\n<p>So, how does the company deal with operating in full view of its customers, competitors and distributors?<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a choice we&#8217;ve made,&#8221; says Dering. &#8220;If we didn&#8217;t want to do Kickstarter campaigns, we&#8217;d have to raise money from somewhere. I&#8217;m not a control freak, but I don&#8217;t see what would be gained from giving up our freedom.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Dering is still the company&#8217;s sole founder, and owns every single share of the company.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I have given around 28 percent of the company to our staff as a &#8216;phantom stock.&#8217; It doesn&#8217;t mean they own part of the company, but they do share in the profits,&#8221; Dering explains. &#8220;I pay myself a salary that&#8217;s big enough to pay for food, rent and my life. If I exceed that and want to pay myself more money out of the company&#8217;s profits, I pay it out as a dividend.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1381968\\\" style=\\\"width: 490px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-1381968\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/bags.gif?w=480&#038;h=243\\\" alt=\\\"Peak Design's current Kickstarter campaign has raised more than $5m and is gunning for the $6m mark. \\\" width=\\\"480\\\" height=\\\"243\\\" \\/><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Peak Design&#8217;s current Kickstarter campaign has raised more than $5 million and is gunning for the $6 million mark.<\\/p><\\/div>\\n<p>In other words, should Dering take $1 million off the table, he would stick $720,000 in his own account and distribute $280,000 to his staff.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I call it a fairness doctrine,&#8221; Dering explains. &#8220;I live a super happy, easy, stress-free life. I want to extend that to my employees. In the meantime, when we\\u2019re all in this together, I like to be at the front lines.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<h2>Clearing a different path<\\/h2>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">I find it intriguing that Peak Design has decided to plot a different path for itself. Like so many of the other startups I write about here on TechCrunch, Peak Design&#8217;s headquarters are in San Francisco. Unlike most of the other companies, Dering &amp; Co. have few aspirations to chase valuations and unicorn status.<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">&#8220;No amount of money can replace this company. I feel like we are a big family. It feels like we are in it together, all winning,&#8221; Dering says. Then, pensively he adds, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had some shitty jobs in my time. With Peak, we&#8217;re optimizing for creating awesome products and optimizing for happiness.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">Optimizing for happiness means optimizing for humor, laughter and feeling comfortable enough to be silly. I&#8217;ve seen that in action whenever I&#8217;ve run into the Peak Design gang at trade shows. For example, the time I came to the company&#8217;s\\u00a0booth and saw it covered in black plastic garbage bags, with its\\u00a0products\\u00a0taped to the sides of the booth.<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1381971\\\" style=\\\"width: 1034px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-1381971 img-full\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/dering-on-the-beach.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=521\\\" alt=\\\"Working hard?

As for the company&#8217;s product?<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">&#8220;Hey, let me get the current campaign out of the way first,&#8221; Dering retorts, refusing to even hint at what might be next. &#8220;I do have 22,000 new backers to look after before we worry about our next campaign.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Most startups toil away in stealth mode on new products with an Apple-esque fear of news leaking before its time.

The spacecraft will journey to a near-Earth asteroid known as Bennu and return an asteroid sample to Earth. This will be NASA&#8217;s first asteroid sample return mission.<\\/p>\\n<p>Designed to return a sample as large as two kilograms, the mission is likely to bring back the largest sample of alien rock since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"fb-video\\\" data-allowfullscreen=\\\"true\\\" data-href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/NASA\\/videos\\/10154405861941772\\/\\\"><\\/div>\\n<p>This mission is the first of its kind for NASA and is a uniquely difficult one.<\\/p>\\n<p>Grabbing a space rock and bringing it back to Earth may not seem that complicated, but mission success for OSIRIS-REx will be dependent on the execution of a number of complex maneuvers over the course of nine years.<\\/p>\\n<p>Here are just a few of the things that NASA\\u2019s asteroid sample return mission must get right to complete a successful mission. OSIRIS-REx will need to fly toward Bennu at 12,000 mph and then pump the brakes to less than 0.5 mph to intercept the asteroid. Then, a relatively large sample will need to be collected in the tricky environment of microgravity. If that sample gets contaminated by anything the spacecraft brought from Earth, or from something else it encounters before it can be delivered to a clean room for analysis, the mission is compromised. So, OSIRIS-REx must go above and beyond to protect that sample, especially during the intense return through the Earth\\u2019s atmosphere.<\\/p>\\n<p>NASA isn&#8217;t the first to attempt this difficult feat. The\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/global.jaxa.jp\\/\\\">Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency<\\/a> (Japan&#8217;s NASA-equivalent organization) launched the first asteroid sample return mission back in 2003, but things went <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/curator.jsc.nasa.gov\\/hayabusa\\/\\\">awry<\\/a> once the spacecraft reached the asteroid and a large sample was unable to be collected.<\\/p>\\n<p>While a successful launch is a great first step, the OSIRIS-REx team won\\u2019t be able to breathe a sigh of relief until September 2025, when the Bennu sample has successfully been brought home and analyzed.<\\/p>\\n<p>OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security-Regolith Explorer, will reach the Bennu asteroid in August, 2018. Upon arrival, the spacecraft will take months to analyze the asteroid and identify a scientifically interesting section to sample.<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1359444\\\" style=\\\"width: 587px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\"><img class=\\\" wp-image-1359444\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/07\\/osiris-rex-survey.gif?w=577&#038;h=394\\\" alt=\\\"OSIRIS-REx surveying Bennu \\/ Image courtesy of the University of Arizona\\\" width=\\\"577\\\" height=\\\"394\\\" \\/><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">OSIRIS-REx surveying Bennu \\/ Image courtesy of the University of Arizona<\\/p><\\/div>\\n<p>A couple of years later, around July 2020, OSIRIS-REx will use a robotic instrument known as <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.asteroidmission.org\\/instrumentation\\/\\\">TAGSAM<\\/a> to make contact with the asteroid and shoot a burst of pure nitrogen gas at the rock. This gas will push bits of the asteroid\\u2019s surface into a sampling chamber.<\\/p>\\n<p>Then, in March, 2021, OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to depart Bennu and begin its trip home. The spacecraft should reenter the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere in September, 2023. At that time, the sample will be delivered for two years of thorough analysis at NASA&#8217;s Johnson Space Center.<\\/p>\\n<p>Why is NASA going through all of this trouble to study an asteroid?<\\/p>\\n<p>Well, for one, this particular asteroid has the potential to impact Earth in the 22<sup>nd <\\/sup>century &#8212; and it\\u2019s large enough to do some damage. Because of this, there\\u2019s the possibility that we may want to intercept Bennu\\u00a0in the future for the purpose of deflection. So, there\\u2019s benefit to flight-testing some of these capabilities now (before some people&#8217;s lives depend on it).<\\/p>\\n<p>There\\u2019s also significant\\u00a0scientific reasons for studying asteroids. Scientists believe that asteroids are primitive rocks &#8212; leftover debris from the formation of the planets in our solar system created billions of years ago.<\\/p>\\n<p>As an added benefit, asteroids don\\u2019t have recycling processes like we have here on Earth (wind, water, tectonic plates, etc.), so they haven\\u2019t changed much since their formation, making them uniquely interesting scientific specimens.<\\/p>\\n<p>Because of their historical significance, studying an asteroid like Bennu could help us understand how planets form.<\\/p>\\n<p>Perhaps the more interesting reason to analyze a Bennu sample is that it could help us understand how life began here on Earth. There\\u2019s a theory known as <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.panspermia-theory.com\\/\\\">panspermia<\\/a> that states that microbial life was carried to Earth by asteroids, meteoroids, comets or other orbiting planetary bodies. Scientists predict that Bennu contains organic materials, which is one of the ingredients for creating life as we know it.<\\/p>\\n<p>To test the panspermia theory, the OSIRIS-REx team will work hard to identify a section of the Benny asteroid that contains organic material for sampling.<\\/p>\\n<p>Nine years may sound like a long time, but NASA\\u2019s most ambitious planetary spacecraft (<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/07\\/14\\/one-year-since-the-new-horizons-pluto-flyby-heres-what-we-learned\\/\\\">New Horizons,<\\/a> <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/voyager.jpl.nasa.gov\\/\\\">Voyager<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/07\\/04\\/after-five-years-juno-arrives-in-orbit-around-jupiter\\/\\\">Juno<\\/a>, etc.) have always taken many years to complete their mission.

As one industry insider told me, there are a million ways to screw up that idea through poor execution, and many, many lose their way. Yet a precious few fight through the problems and the challenges, and somehow, with a bit of luck and a lot of moxie, make it to IPO.<\\/p>\\n<p>The four original founders of Box, one of those companies that made it through that long journey, talked about their experience in a panel discussion this week at BoxWorks.<\\/p>\\n<p>While CEO Aaron Levie and CFO Dylan Smith have long been the public faces of Box, there were two others &#8212; Jeff Queisser, chief systems architect and Sam Ghods, services architect &#8212; all childhood friends in Seattle, who quit college to follow the startup dream.<\\/p>\\n<h2>The idea<\\/h2>\\n<p>The group seemed destined to launch some sort of startup, and often bounced ideas off one another, even after they went their separate ways to college. After Levie came up with the idea of what would be Box as part of a marketing class, the group saw potential &#8212; at least Smith did. Ghods\\u00a0didn&#8217;t see the value right away, but eventually all four were on board and Box was born.<\\/p>\\n<p>These guys were living a Silicon Valley clich\\u00e9 in the early days, giving birth to their idea in a dorm room, then quitting school and renting out a converted garage that acted as their office and living space. You have to remember, these were four young men in their early twenties with no business experience whatsoever, yet they fell into their roles, as Levie with some marketing classes would be CEO, Smith with his financial sensibilities became CFO, Ghods\\u00a0with some coding background headed up engineering and Queisser, who had spent summers installing cable modems, became the de facto head of IT.<\\/p>\\n<div data-shortcode=\\\"caption\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1382517\\\" style=\\\"width: 590px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-1382517\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/fullsizerender-7.jpg?w=580&#038;h=366\\\" alt=\\\"Box's four founders around 2005 outside their converted garage apartment\\/headquarters.\\\" width=\\\"580\\\" height=\\\"366\\\" \\/><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Box&#8217;s four founders around 2005 outside their converted garage apartment\\/headquarters.<\\/p><\\/div>\\n<p>The core group soon began selling Box subscriptions and were making a little bit of money. They even found an early backer at DFJ, who gave them some initial funding and helped form\\u00a0their fledgling board of directors.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Moving beyond the core group<\\/h2>\\n<p>One of the first inflection points for any startup is when you move beyond the core group of founders and begin to look for additional employees. The core group has passion, and in the case of Box, were four guys who had grown up together, further complicating the hiring dynamic &#8212; but as with everything, they had some luck in the deal (and they have some advice for those starting on that journey now).<\\/p>\\n<p>The core team knew they were looking for a good cultural fit, but they were warned don&#8217;t get people who have the same exact skills and think just the way you\\u00a0do because you\\u00a0just get an echo chamber. Early on, any startup needs people who can cover a lot of jobs. When you get a little bigger, specialization begins to take\\u00a0over.<\\/p>\\n<p>Even if they weren&#8217;t quite sure what\\u00a0they were looking for, they had a sense. They definitely had a &#8220;no asshole&#8221; rule and they needed someone they would be comfortable brainstorming with in a small room for hours. They lucked out when they brought in Karen Appleton as their eighth or ninth employee. She brought a level of professionalism and business experience the founders lacked, and she encouraged them to form partnerships.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;We were 19 or 20 years old. We didn\\u2019t know how it would work to hire more experienced people. Karen was the first of those hires and changed our hiring trajectory from cultural fit to cultural add,&#8221; Smith explained.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Changing direction<\\/h2>\\n<p>One thing that most startups do is pivot from the original idea, and Box was no exception. In about 2007, they began to recognize that consumer online storage was becoming increasingly specialized with Flickr handling photos and YouTube video. They didn&#8217;t think they could compete with that, and at the same time they began to recognize a need for a file-sharing product for business.<\\/p>\\n<p>[pullquote author=&#8221;Box CEO Aaron Levie&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221;]&#8221;I had a simple rule of thumb. Bet on whatever Steve Jobs is betting on.[\\/pullquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>There were a lot of heavy discussions about how to proceed. Eventually Box switched to the enterprise, but\\u00a0they didn&#8217;t make the transition\\u00a0willy-nilly. They actually went out and hired a consultant, who made some calls and gathered some data for them to confirm they were making a sound decision. You have to remember in 2007, the iPhone was just coming out and it wasn&#8217;t obvious that content and collaboration would move to the cloud. The consultant confirmed that some companies were thinking about this and there would be a business in that space.<\\/p>\\n<p>There was still a lot of discussion among the founders, but they eventually all agreed it was the way to go &#8212; and it turned out to be a good decision.<\\/p>\\n<p>A couple of years later, the iPad came out and this was a major\\u00a0turning point. &#8220;I had a simple rule of thumb. Bet on whatever Steve Jobs is betting on,&#8221; Levie\\u00a0joked. The company turned its attention to the iPad right away and was one of the first enterprise companies with an iPad app. It was then that they realized content management was changing in a big way and it was going to be about protecting content\\u00a0in motion.<\\/p>\\n<h2>It&#8217;s a learning process<\\/h2>\\n<p>The founders learned you need to compromise, and that was all part of the process. They also were voracious readers, and reading books like <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business\\/dp\\/0062060244\\\">The\\u00a0Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma<\\/a> and <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream\\/dp\\/0060517123\\\">Crossing the Chasm<\\/a> helped shape the company philosophy over time.<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>They all recommend getting mentors and learning as much as you can, because it&#8217;s tough going it on your own. You don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know, and mentors who have been through the startup experience can help point you in the right direction &#8212; and they found when they asked, people generally wanted to help.<\\/p>\\n<p>They also say there will be scary moments in the life of any company. They point to 2008 when they went looking for a Series B round in the middle of a huge economic crisis as one of those times.<\\/p>\\n<p>There will also be tough times. You will definitely fight with your co-founders and you may question what you&#8217;re doing, but if you believe in the core mission, you can reach the goal of becoming a public company. It worked for Box &#8212; and it&#8217;s worth noting that the four founders remained close friends through it all.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>It may not seem it, but coming up with an idea for your startup is probably the easiest part of launching your own company.

However, the industry remains ripe for change.<\\/p>\\n<p>The unique eccentricities of the sports industry &#8212; where the focus has typically been on improving the performance of the athletes and the size of sponsorship deals &#8212; have held back progress as the broader business world has benefited from a wave of tech-enabled productivity gains.<\\/p>\\n<p>It\\u2019s hard to believe, but in the world of cricket, many sports associations and bodies continue to record their assets (in this instance, the &#8220;cricket match&#8221;) on paper and have no way of directly communicating with their customers. And while the national governing boards invest in technology to improve the performance of their teams, it\\u2019s not being leveraged to identify future stars and fans early. Ultimately, they should be managing their customers from cradle to grave &#8212; i.e. from when they first start playing or watching the <span class=\\\"il\\\">sport<\\/span> right through their lives as fans.<\\/p>\\n<p>One of the biggest challenges facing major sports leagues is the flat-lining growth in home markets, where demographic expansion is slowing; population growth has virtually flat-lined in Europe, while rising at a mere\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.usnews.com\\/opinion\\/blogs\\/robert-schlesinger\\/articles\\/2016-01-05\\/us-population-in-2016-according-to-census-estimates-322-762-018\\\">0.77 percent in the U.S<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, the emerging markets offer both vast audiences (<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.census.gov\\/popclock\\/\\\">more than 2.5 billion consumers in China and India alone<\\/a>) and an emerging middle-class with an interest in western culture and sports. Whilst sports leagues are increasingly scheduling friendlies and regular-seasonal games in overseas markets, the opportunity to engage a global fan base using digital and social platforms is enormous.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;left&#8221;]Even as political and economic uncertainties foster a more cautious investment climate in the broader technology industry, the passion of sports fans will endure.

With more than\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/07\\/27\\/facebook-earnings-q2-2016\\/\\\">1.7 billion monthly active users on Facebook<\\/a>,\\u00a0and many millions more on other social channels around the world, there is an incredible opportunity for all manner of sports to reach a vast global audience &#8212;\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.ft.com\\/content\\/7593cd8c-7041-11e4-bc6a-00144feabdc0\\\">Facebook alone has 500 million &#8220;hardcore\\u00a0football fans.&#8221;<\\/a>\\u00a0But the greatest beneficiaries may turn about to be the smaller sports properties, whose avid fan bases are underserved by linear broadcast and cable TV. This <span class=\\\"il\\\">will<\\/span> no doubt have a profound impact on women\\u2019s sports, for example.<\\/p>\\n<p>Social media is also advancing the experience for viewers of prime-time sports fixtures, providing an additional and complementary experience outside of sports events. The\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/gopro.com\\/news\\/gopro-back-on-the-ice-with-nhl-nhlpa-partnership\\\">NHL\\u2019s partnership with\\u00a0GoPro<\\/a>\\u00a0to provide hockey fans with a &#8220;behind-the-scenes&#8221; look at the game is one of a growing number of examples of how social media is bringing fans closer to the action both on and off the ice\\/pitch\\/field. Of course, the emergence of VR, too,\\u00a0<span class=\\\"il\\\">will<\\/span> have fascinating implications for sports fans all over the world.<\\/p>\\n<p>The sports-betting industry has long been a key contributor to the sports industry and an important part of the sports experience for many fans.

Ninety percent of all Americans live within 20 minutes of a Wal-Mart store.

Brick-and-mortar infrastructure is vastly different from e-commerce infrastructure. You don\\u2019t just flip a few switches and turn a giant retail store into a provisioning warehouse (though you could argue that most big box stores are just huge, confusing warehouses anyway).<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">But <span class=\\\"il\\\">Walmart<\\/span> needs to triage its general merchandise business now, before it winds up dying on the vine with the rest of the retail market.

But Walmart doesn&#8217;t know anything about you when you walk into one of its superstores.

In the future, the car will take the place of the human to connect with SpotHero, which connects with the garage to reserve and pay for the space.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;It could be an algorithm that says, &#8216;I need this autonomous pod or car to be stored for x amount of time,&#8217; and it will run some calculations,&#8221; Lawrence said in our phone interview. &#8220;The algorithm will check to see if it can park farther for cheaper, and take traffic into account.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The challenge, today and tomorrow, is that the garages have to be online for this to work, whether it&#8217;s a human or a car that wants to connect. &#8220;Parking facilities have to be online or they&#8217;re invisible,&#8221; Lawrence said. &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to be able to capture the largest share unless they&#8217;re visible.

That&#8217;s what Ernestine Fu, a part-time\\u00a0partner at Alsop Louie partners, is hoping to get done with a new company called <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blackstormlabs.com\\\">Blackstorm<\\/a>. The company said today that it has raised $33.5 million from investors like\\u00a0Rakuten, Highland Capital, executives at Oculus, and a number of other angel investors, as well as Alsop Louie.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;If you think about the market right now, everyones using apps right now, all apps are built on iOS\\u00a0and Android, and the distribution\\u00a0is controlled\\u00a0by Apple and Google. Giant companies like Uber and Lyft have been entirely\\u00a0built entirely on these app stores. If you think about whats next, where are we actually going to have new distribution platforms, that can exist in the form of one messenger, apps within app environments, IoT, mobile browsers, the goal of this company is powering the infrastructure to trade and distribute\\u00a0software to all the post app-store platforms.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]The hope is, while starting with messenger bots and mobile browsers, eventually this kind of development platform and distribution will be able to spread to all sorts of emerging computing platforms like IoT or in-car experiences. Sure, platform shifts\\u00a0<em>do<\\/em> happen regularly, but they can be highly unpredictable. There was a moment in time where it seemed likely that Facebook on the web would be the dominant interface for developers \\u2014 and it worked for things like games \\u2014 but eventually usage shifted almost entirely to mobile.<\\/p>\\n<p>Now, it would seem, the race is on for Messenger applications. Case in point, Apple is opening up its iMessage service to third-party developers (as well as a whole lot of other things), and Facebook and Slack are aggressively trying to attract developers to build bots and other services within the platform. A lot of this is playing catch-up to the experience originally created and popularized by WeChat in China, Fu said, and is long overdue.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Every time there&#8217;s a new platform that&#8217;s created, there&#8217;s new problems,&#8221; Fu said. &#8220;There&#8217;s two in particular that stand out, the first one is it&#8217;s hard for developers to embrace new tools and technology. The second aspect in the beginning it&#8217;s also very inefficient to distribute to users. And at the end of the life cycle it gets really\\u00a0inefficient in that only the Triple-A top tier content with millions in marketing will have a big audience. I think traditionally platform shifts have endured these pains over many years and evolved to have a mutual balance, but now there&#8217;s an explosion of computing platforms.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Right now, Blackstorm consists of two products: what Fu is calling the Neo Store, and a development environment that can spread across multiple different types of user experiences like messengers. The former is a white-label service for companies like telecom providers to deliver additional content beyond using just an App Store using web portals, Fu said. The latter, for now, includes an IDE, but the aim there is to just make it easy for developers to publish across multiple platforms regardless of the experience.<\\/p>\\n<p>But with the emergence of new platforms comes the race to develop for it, get there first, and stick a flag in it in order to attract early adopters. Of course, silly apps will be there, but developers will eventually create use cases that piggyback and work really well on messengers, and they&#8217;ll eventually be starting with just one (probably Facebook, the biggest one). They&#8217;re going to need to find ways to branch out to new platforms as they emerge, as well as existing ones, and that&#8217;s something that Blackstorm hopes to facilitate.<\\/p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s also going to require a shift in user behavior. Normally we interface with a bunch of squares on our screen that we download from the App Store. There&#8217;s certainly a lot of drop-off from between someone linking an app through a messenger to downloading the app, and inevitably setting up an account. The square grid on your phone probably isn&#8217;t going away \\u2014 you can already save web applications to the screen, for example \\u2014 but the whole experience of sharing and playing around with apps is likely shifting to suit whatever environment you exist in at the moment you want to interact with it.<\\/p>\\n<p>Apple has taken a lot of effort to level the playing field for the App Store. It recently <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/09\\/01\\/apple-is-going-to-remove-abandoned-apps-from-the-app-store\\/\\\">began efforts to\\u00a0remove\\u00a0abandoned apps and fight spammy app names<\\/a>. All this is aimed to make the App Store experience more palatable, but it&#8217;s hard to say if that will be successful. Developers are going to follow the audience and a more seamless development experience may end up also attracting early adopters.<\\/p>\\n<p>Fu thinks that Blackstorm will one day be able to replace the App Store. That&#8217;s pretty aggressive and for the foreseeable future, seems really unlikely. But that&#8217;s not to say that it can&#8217;t co-exist with the App Store for the time being \\u2014 and, who knows what the future holds as user behavior shifts. WeChat is a prime example of a ton of usage existing within a different application beyond just an App Store. Other new platforms, like VR and various connected devices, are also still in their infancy and it&#8217;s not clear if they will become widely used.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Managing the App Store can be one of the most difficult experiences for new developers.

Users input their mobile phone number to pay for goods directly. People\\u00a0are comfortable processing &#8220;hundreds of millions of transactions&#8221; on the platform, but Digit has been discovering that all of that changes when the transaction moves from spending to saving.<\\/p>\\n<p>Bloch gives an explanation\\u00a0rooted in behavioral science to explain why his Digit savings service works better through a mobile application. Bloch noticed that engagement was double in the mobile application. He explained this data point by saying that users want to feel their money is cordoned off and protected.\\u00a0Fundamentally there is nothing different in how money is managed on\\u00a0an\\u00a0SMS service or one run through a mobile app. However, an app provides the illusion of separateness, a private place users can check their balance. And while it may seem silly, small details like this matter in the real world.<\\/p>\\n<p>The shift seems to be working as the company has grown to manage $30 million in savings every month, up from the $20 million we reported back in June.

Google, Amazon, Facebook and Uber are near monopolies that provide services as integral to our modern life as power, telephone and transportation systems were a century ago.<\\/p>\\n<p>But there is a key difference between last century\\u2019s utilities and today\\u2019s: Instead of simply delivering a service, today\\u2019s utilities use algorithms to shape our entire life experience. From the news we see and the routes we drive, to the price we pay for goods and services, algorithms influence them all.<\\/p>\\n<p>With algorithms in play, companies can optimize for every variable. Uber efficiently dispatches its drivers during rush hour, Facebook displays the most relevant stories to its users and Amazon can suggest the right product at the optimal time to drive a purchase. For all their positives, what algorithms aren\\u2019t optimized for is doing the <em>right<\\/em> thing or for displaying any amount of transparency.<\\/p>\\n<p>From the outside, there\\u2019s no understanding of how decisions are made inside those software-driven black boxes, and no way to know if the companies are overtly or inadvertently behaving badly. The algorithms that manage internal operations strongly favor doing whatever is the most expedient, efficient and effective, even if that means excluding some people from information or services, or leaving the door open to amplifying societal biases.<\\/p>\\n<p>This has to change, and these companies themselves must take the lead in creating algorithmic accountability in their services. This goes beyond <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.airbnb.com\\/an-update-on-the-airbnb-anti-discrimination-review\\/\\\">pledging to do more to promote fairness in access as Airbnb did<\\/a> earlier this year, and extends to creating a level of automated transparency that would let consumers, the press, the technology community or public officials look in and see what\\u2019s going on.<\\/p>\\n<p>The industry shouldn\\u2019t rely on government to play this role. Old-school regulations &#8212; the kinds written by lawmakers and bureaucrats &#8212; are too cumbersome to keep up with technology and too \\u201cdumb\\u201d to monitor algorithms in a timely way. Government-led regulation would burden tech companies and slow innovation. Prime example: 20th-century electric utilities and how regulation stifled investment and innovation for decades.<\\/p>\\n<p>The last thing we need is for companies to become as innovation-starved as the highly regulated electric utilities. At the turn of the last century, regulation brought order to the chaos of competing standards and fly-by-night outfits. But in a short time, regulators dictated a \\u201ccost-plus\\u201d business model for the industry. For decades this meant the utilities had zero incentive to pursue cleaner, more distributed sources of energy, or to invest in any innovation at all. Regulation fostered a mindset that exacerbated climate change issues, which we\\u2019re only now beginning to make progress against.<\\/p>\\n<p>[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;right&#8221;]Software-defined regulation can monitor software-driven industries better than regulations enforced by squads of regulators.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>To avoid a similar fate, these new utilities (the Googles, Amazons and Ubers of the world) must proactively build algorithmic accountability into their systems, faithfully and transparently act as their own watchdogs or risk eventual onerous regulation.<\\/p>\\n<p>Concern about \\u201cblack box\\u201d algorithms that govern our lives has been spreading. New York University\\u2019s Information Law Institute<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.law.nyu.edu\\/centers\\/ili\\/algorithmsconference\\\"> hosted<\\/a> a conference on algorithmic accountability, noting: \\u201cScholars, stakeholders, and policymakers question the adequacy of existing mechanisms governing algorithmic decision-making and grapple with new challenges presented by the rise of algorithmic power in terms of transparency, fairness, and equal treatment.\\u201d Yale Law School\\u2019s Information Society Project is studying this, too. \\u201cAlgorithmic modeling may be biased or limited, and the <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/isp.yale.edu\\/event\\/unlocking-black-box-promise-and-limits-algorithmic-accountability-professions\\\">uses of algorithms are still opaque in many critical sectors<\\/a>,\\u201d the group concluded.<\\/p>\\n<p>Software-defined regulation can monitor software-driven industries better than regulations enforced by squads of regulators. Algorithms can watch emerging utilities such as Facebook and Uber 24\\/7, seeing details and patterns that humans might never catch. If transportation officials who regulated taxis want make sure Uber doesn\\u2019t shun certain neighborhoods or bias its service, they should write an algorithm to look for the behavior.<\\/p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s just as important to have algorithms that keep an eye on the role of humans inside these companies. We want technology that can tell if <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2016\\/06\\/20\\/technology\\/airbnb-vows-to-fight-racism-but-its-users-cant-sue-to-prompt-fairness.html?_r=0\\\">Airbnb hosts are illegally turning down minorities<\\/a> or if Facebook\\u2019s human editors are <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/gizmodo.com\\/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006\\\">squashing conservative news headlines<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>The watchdog algorithms can be like open-source software &#8212; open to examination by anyone. That way, coders can see if the watchdog algorithms are monitoring the right things, while the companies keep private proprietary algorithms and data.<\\/p>\\n<p>There\\u2019s another benefit &#8212; perhaps a huge one &#8212; to software-defined regulation. It will also show us a path to a more efficient government. The world&#8217;s legal logic and regulations can be coded into software and smart sensors can offer real-time monitoring of everything from air and water quality, traffic flows and queues at the DMV. Regulators define the rules, technologist create the software to implement them and then AI and ML help refine iterations of policies going forward. This should lead to much more efficient, effective governments at the local, national and global levels.<\\/p>\\n<p>Still, we now need a conversation about how to make this work. Technology companies and policymakers need to come together and share ideas &#8212; which is too rare in this software-in-everything era. It\\u2019s clear that following this path we are on will result in regulatory schemes governing social networks, search and other key services, making them as dull and bureaucratic as electric companies.

That is, Yala\\u00a0uses algorithms and machine learning to determine the best time to post in order to increase your exposure and receive better engagement on the items you&#8217;re sharing.<\\/p>\\n<p>The idea for the bot comes from Gary Levitt, who previously <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2014\\/08\\/20\\/godaddy-acquires-mailchimp-competitor-mad-mimi-to-beef-up-its-email-marketing-service\\/\\\">sold his email marketing startup Mad Mimi to GoDaddy<\\/a> back in 2014.

That led to the pivot to Yala instead &#8211; something that addressed a problem Levitt faced himself while building Pinecone.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;I was dissatisfied with Buffer, and its less impressive competitors, because multi-channel posting took time,&#8221; explains Levitt, &#8220;especially when it came to scheduling across many channels, editing, choosing times and composing,&#8221; he says.<\\/p>\\n<p><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/buffer.com\\\">Buffer<\\/a>, by way of background, is a social media scheduling service, which <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/buffer.com\\/optimal-scheduling\\/connect\\\">also offers tools<\\/a> that help you determine the best time to publish.<\\/p>\\n<p>However, with Yala, the idea is to bring a similar sort of intelligence a bit &#8220;closer to home,&#8221; says Levitt &#8211; meaning, Slack.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\t\\t<style type='text\\/css'>\\n\\t\\t\\t#gallery-1382286-2 {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmargin: auto;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t#gallery-1382286-2 .gallery-item {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfloat: left;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmargin-top: 10px;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttext-align: center;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twidth: 33%;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t#gallery-1382286-2 img {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t#gallery-1382286-2 .gallery-caption {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmargin-left: 0;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\\/media.php *\\/\\n\\t\\t<\\/style>\\n\\t\\t<div data-carousel-extra='{\\\"blog_id\\\":24588526,\\\"permalink\\\":\\\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/techcrunch.com\\\\\\/2016\\\\\\/09\\\\\\/08\\\\\\/yalas-new-chatbot-knows-the-best-time-to-post-to-social-networks\\\\\\/\\\"}' id='gallery-1382286-2' class='gallery galleryid-1382286 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\\n\\t\\t\\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href='https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/09\\/08\\/yalas-new-chatbot-knows-the-best-time-to-post-to-social-networks\\/screenshot-of-yala-posting-image\\/'><img width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"146\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screenshot-of-yala-posting-image.png?w=150&#038;h=146\\\" class=\\\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\\\" alt=\\\"screenshot-of-yala-posting-image\\\" data-attachment-id=\\\"1382365\\\" data-orig-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screenshot-of-yala-posting-image.png\\\" data-orig-size=\\\"898,873\\\" data-comments-opened=\\\"1\\\" data-image-meta=\\\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\\\" data-image-title=\\\"screenshot-of-yala-posting-image\\\" data-image-description=\\\"\\\" data-medium-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screenshot-of-yala-posting-image.png?w=300\\\" data-large-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screenshot-of-yala-posting-image.png?w=680\\\" \\/><\\/a>\\n\\t\\t\\t<\\/dt><\\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\\n\\t\\t\\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href='https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/09\\/08\\/yalas-new-chatbot-knows-the-best-time-to-post-to-social-networks\\/screenshot-of-yala\\/'><img width=\\\"150\\\" height=\\\"102\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screenshot-of-yala.png?w=150&#038;h=102\\\" class=\\\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\\\" alt=\\\"screenshot-of-yala\\\" data-attachment-id=\\\"1382364\\\" data-orig-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screenshot-of-yala.png\\\" data-orig-size=\\\"898,612\\\" data-comments-opened=\\\"1\\\" data-image-meta=\\\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\\\" data-image-title=\\\"screenshot-of-yala\\\" data-image-description=\\\"\\\" data-medium-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screenshot-of-yala.png?w=300\\\" data-large-file=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/screenshot-of-yala.png?w=680\\\" \\/><\\/a>\\n\\t\\t\\t<\\/dt><\\/dl>\\n\\t\\t\\t<br style='clear: both' \\/>\\n\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\n<p>To determine the best time to post, Yala looks at your social media posting history to determine which times and posts led to the most shares, likes and clicks.

Love Mondays, which was founded in 2014 and has 20 employees, had raised around $2 million in funding with investors <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2015\\/04\\/15\\/in-latest-deals-brazilian-investor-kaszek-ventures-doubles-down-on-women-entrepreneurs\\/\\\">including Kaszek Ventures<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>Love Mondays also participated earlier this summer in Google&#8217;s\\u00a0Launchpad accelerator program <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2015\\/12\\/16\\/google-launchpad-accelerator\\/\\\">aimed at startups from Brazil, India and Indonesia<\\/a>. That came with an equity-free $50,000, but Glassdoor tells me that Love Mondays declined because the startup was\\u00a0already in talks with Glassdoor. (Does this make Love Mondays the first exit from Google&#8217;s\\u00a0accelerator? I&#8217;ll ask.)<\\/p>\\n<p>The acquisition\\u00a0is only the second that Glassdoor has made in its history, its first in seven years, and its first acquisition outside of the U.S.<\\/p>\\n<p>Its first was in 2009, of a company called <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/archive.boston.com\\/business\\/technology\\/innoeco\\/2009\\/10\\/twitter_helped_me_sell_my_comp.html\\\">JobVent<\\/a>, which\\u00a0let workers\\u00a0post anonymous reviews of their employers. JobVent\\u00a0was\\u00a0<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/jobitorial#\\/entity\\\">renamed\\u00a0Jobitorial<\\/a>\\u00a0by Glassdoor, and eventually\\u00a0its database and tech were integrated\\u00a0completely into Glassdoor itself. It&#8217;s something of an early move in Twitter commerce: JobVent&#8217;s\\u00a0founder, who had moved on somewhere else, offered his site in a Tweet and someone at Glassdoor followed up, Hohman told\\u00a0me.<\\/p>\\n<p>Similar to JobVent, Love Mondays plans to keep its brand &#8220;for the foreseeable future&#8221;. While that will help Glassdoor (and Love Mondays)\\u00a0continue building a local business under its existing brand, it will also give Glassdoor a bigger selection of regions (and languages) that it can market to larger multinationals that want to hire more people specifically in Brazil.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cLove Mondays is excited to join forces with Glassdoor to help connect national and multinational companies with top notch Brazilian talent,\\u201d said Luciana Caletti, CEO of Love Mondays, who <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/love-mondays#\\/entity\\\">co-founded the company<\\/a> with David Curran (who is also her husband) and Shane O&#8217;Grady. \\u201cGlassdoor\\u2019s reputation and management team make the company an ideal partner to help take Love Mondays to the next level. I couldn\\u2019t be more excited about our future prospects together.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>While Love Mondays was growing nicely and Caletti told me that it had some solid plans to expand across all of Latin America (which seems to dovetail with Glassdoor&#8217;s ambitions too), right now is a time of consolidation in the online career space. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/07\\/01\\/indeed-owner-recruit-holdings-confirms-acquisition-of-simply-hired\\/\\\">Simply Hired has been acquired<\\/a> by Recruit Holdings (owner of Indeed); Monster has been <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/08\\/08\\/randstad-buys-monster-for-429m-as-recruitment-consolidation-continues\\/\\\">snapped up<\\/a> by Holland&#8217;s Randstad; and biggest of all, LinkedIn &#8212; a major platform for recruitment in the professional sector &#8212; is being <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/06\\/13\\/microsoft-to-buy-linkedin-for-26b-in-cash-makes-big-move-into-enterprise-social-media\\/\\\">bought by Microsoft<\\/a> for $26.2 billion.<\\/p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s before you consider the plethora of smaller acquisitions that have taken place. In that context, it&#8217;s no surprise that Love Mondays would get bought, and Glassdoor would do the buying of a clone, to scale up.<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">&#8220;These businesses\\u00a0work better at scale, that is the bottom line,&#8221; Hohman told me. He would not comment on whether Glassdoor will be doing more of the consolidating.<\\/p>\\n<p>Prior to the acquisition, Glassdoor&#8217;s footprint extended into providing localised experiences 11 markets and six languages: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, France, India, Ireland, Holland, Austria, Switzerland, the U.S. and the U.K. \\u00a0But interestingly, the viral growth of the site has meant that it actually had managed to collect employee feedback in across 190 countries.<\\/p>\\n<p>Love Mondays will\\u00a0give the company a more formal window into growing across Portuguese-speaking countries, and specifically to pick up a business that is already up and running in Brazil, Latin America&#8217;s biggest market; as well as potentially expanding into other countries in the region (and languages &#8212; Spanish being the more popular of the two across Latin America).<\\/p>\\n<p>Love Mondays\\u00a0already provides reviews and listings for some 75,000 employers in Brazil, Glassdoor says. As a point of context, Glassdoor currently lists reviews and jobs for around 580,000\\u00a0businesses in its database, and it makes money when those companies pay to have better access to update and tweak their profiles.

These initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand, and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Now there are two schools of thought here &#8212; one of which is that Apple is explicitly promising a &#8220;sell out&#8221; and thus the iPhone 7 is a sewn-up, in-the-bag home run. And,\\u00a0in a perfect world where Apple&#8217;s\\u00a0supply chain had limitless on-demand\\u00a0capacity, it\\u00a0could shift more iPhones than it can in\\u00a0the real world, where even Cook&#8217;s supply chain expertise can only stretch manufacturing capacity so far. So why should Apple\\u00a0report a smaller number of iPhone sales than demand for new\\u00a0iPhones\\u00a0exists?<\\/p>\\n<p>The other school of thought is that Apple is cloaking traditional first weekend iPhone sales because it&#8217;s rather less confident about\\u00a0its controversial decision to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack than\\u00a0Phil Schiller made out on stage yesterday. So less #Courage, more #Contingency.<\\/p>\\n<p>The new iPhones also don&#8217;t represent a big design overhaul\\u00a0over last year&#8217;s models (or indeed the year before) &#8212; which might also discourage iOS users from upgrading.\\u00a0In saturated smartphone markets skipping an\\u00a0upgrade cycle or two might not seem such a big deal when this year&#8217;s iPhones look much the same as\\u00a02014&#8217;s models.<\\/p>\\n<p>Add to that\\u00a0Cupertino of course remains\\u00a0massively scrutinized so any perceived blip in early iPhone 7 sales figures could\\u00a0rebound painfully on its bottom line.\\u00a0So &#8212; eyeing\\u00a0shareholder value &#8212; why take the risk of revealing sales figures when you don&#8217;t have to?\\u00a0Just\\u00a0be sure to get that message out early, i.e. ahead of pre-orders, rather than once orders have started flowing and\\/or\\u00a0the world&#8217;s media is expecting you to drop an impressive set of digits.<\\/p>\\n<p>#Control.<\\/p>\\n<p>Which just leaves the sales guesstimates&#8230;<\\/p>\\n<p>Speculating on Apple&#8217;s decision not to release first weekend sales for the iPhone 7, analyst Ben Bajarin tweets that he&#8217;s expecting &#8220;roughly flat&#8221; sales figures &#8212; in the region of 10 million units&#8230;<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"embed-twitter\\\">\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" align=\\\"center\\\" data-width=\\\"500\\\">\\n<p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Meaning opening weekend numbers will roughly flat so ~10m units.

But less sensational <span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span> models are already here, <span class=\\\"il\\\">now<\\/span>, improving our everyday experiences. They\\u2019re great. And we should talk about them more.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">A broad array of companies are quietly innovating on top of <span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span> technologies &#8212; and integrating the resulting innovations into services today. Their models are showing us the right products (e.g. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/expedia\\\">Expedia<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/gettyimages\\\">Getty Images<\\/a>), serving smarter ads (e.g. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/gumgum#\\/entity\\\">GumGum<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/pinterest\\\">Pinterest<\\/a>), organizing our content (e.g. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/gopro\\\">GoPro<\\/a>, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/organization\\/microsoft#\\/entity\\\">Microsoft<\\/a>), guiding investments (e.g. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.sentient.ai\\/\\\">Sentient<\\/a>), talking to us in the words we understand (e.g. DoCoMo, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.crunchbase.com\\/product\\/ibm-watson\\\">IBM Watson<\\/a>) and more. Each of these is one of our customers, and each of them is filled with smart people working hard to improve their products using <span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span>. Many of them work on agile software teams. Over time, their incremental progress will revolutionize technology. But don\\u2019t expect to wake up tomorrow as Bruce Willis in \\u201cSurrogates.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<h2>Not just for the big platforms anymore<\\/h2>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">In this <span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span> Spring, we\\u2019re seeing big news almost daily, much of it brought to us by the tech behemoths we all know and love. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, Apple and others are constantly making waves with new <span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span> projects and developments. And these companies are <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/pitchbook.com\\/news\\/articles\\/tech-giants-paying-big-money-for-ai-talent\\\">paying big money for <span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span> startups<\\/a> (recent examples include <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.geekwire.com\\/2016\\/exclusive-apple-acquires-turi-major-exit-seattle-based-machine-learning-ai-startup\\/\\\">Turi<\\/a> and <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/fortune.com\\/2016\\/08\\/09\\/intel-machine-learning-nervana\\/\\\">Nervana<\\/a>). It\\u2019s <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/2016\\/03\\/26\\/technology\\/the-race-is-on-to-control-artificial-intelligence-and-techs-future.html?_r=0\\\">war<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">[tc_writerquote align=&#8221;left&#8221;]It\\u2019s not just who has the models, it\\u2019s about who applies the right data.[\\/tc_writerquote]<\\/p>\\n<p>But AIs are not just for the big guys. Why? Three reasons. First, the affordability of massive computing power. Indeed, the commoditization of compute power is a large part of why the big cloud platforms want you developing models on top of Azure, AWS, Watson and GCP, and why Intel and NVIDIA want you doing it on their silicon. Second, there are more ML- and <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/backchannel.com\\/how-google-is-remaking-itself-as-a-machine-learning-first-company-ada63defcb70#.pn5l1ez1k\\\"><span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span>-trained engineers<\\/a> than ever before, taking advantage of decades of science advancing the underlying algorithms.<\\/p>\\n<p>Third, largely behind the scenes, product teams from startups to retailers and systems integrators are applying others\\u2019 <span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span> platforms using their own proprietary training data. The most sophisticated algorithms are only able to see, listen, talk and \\u201cthink\\u201d like humans if the right humans are training and re-training them as our fickle human opinions evolve. Nobody understands shoes like Shoes.com, surfing videos like GoPro, top-shelf stock imagery like Getty &#8212; and their customers.<\\/p>\\n<p>Sometimes the ability to leverage cognitive computing is less about the underlying algorithms and more about how they are tuned and productized. Mark my words: It\\u2019s not just who has the models, it\\u2019s about who applies the right data.<\\/p>\\n<h2>A means, not an end<\\/h2>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Lastly, can we please stop evaluating AIs based on whether they are saving us from cancer or threatening humanity? These questions bait valuable conversations, but miss the bigger, more important \\u201cmiddle.\\u201d I love telling my mom that we train AIs. But AIs are not the goal.\\u00a0When we all go to that tech-loving part of our brain, we forget that AIs are the <em>means<\\/em> to improved experiences.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>We all accept that a picture is \\u201cworth a thousand words.\\u201d We also know that most of our communication is non-verbal (just contrast your last date, or in-person interview, with your last telecon call). So how much are 100 million images worth? How about terabytes of CT scans of your loved one\\u2019s brain tumor? And what about 24 hours of video, at 30 fps? Well, of course, that depends on what\\u2019s in the data &#8212; and, more importantly, what we can do with it.<\\/p>\\n<p>AIs hold the key to unlocking the value buried in the massive, exponentially growing sets of unstructured content with which we each interact daily.<\\/p>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">As such, I humbly propose that we measure the value of an <span class=\\\"il\\\">AI<\\/span> based on its ability to contribute positive utility to people. We all know that at the end of the day, it\\u2019s the people who matter in our lives. Just the same, we need to remember that AIs should be measured by their ability to understand, interact with and improve people\\u2019s lives. This utilitarian framework offers hundreds of years of insights from philosophers, economists and anthropologists.<\\/p>\\n<h2>The new nukes<\\/h2>\\n<p dir=\\\"ltr\\\">AIs are pervasive, and are creating the power to spread good and bad. Time and time again, people have managed to guide innovations for the good of humanity. In some ways, AIs remind me of nuclear technologies. Handled poorly, they could destroy the world. But they haven\\u2019t. In fact, we have avoided another world war thanks in part to mutual assured destruction, and atomic know-how has quietly revolutionized healthcare, energy, robotics, physics and aerospace.<\\/p>\\n<p>Yes, the extremes are scary, but they are only part of the story. If we are to harness AIs for universal good, we need to be more realistic about their daily implications and the net benefits thereof. Less \\u201cduck and cover\\u201d and more comprehensive conversation.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>Artificial intelligence is changing the way we interact with our devices, friends and data.

This includes access to a number of top TV channels, like ESPN, Disney, AMC, Comedy Central, HGTV, TNT, TBS, FOX\\u00a0and NBC (in select markets), A&amp;E, VICELAND and CNN.<\\/p>\\n<p>Subscribers\\u00a0can then choose to customize their channel lineup further by selecting various add-on packs for $5\\/month. This lets\\u00a0you\\u00a0access additional channels, grouped by genres\\u00a0like &#8220;kids,&#8221; &#8220;sports,&#8221; &#8220;comedy,&#8221; and more. Premium channels like HBO, Cinemax, and now, Starz, are also available.<\\/p>\\n<p>In fact, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/news.sling.com\\/press-release\\/programming\\/starz-add-pack-launches-sling-tv-free-preview\\\">Starz and Starz Encore were just added today<\\/a>, and the pack is being offered for free until September 14th as a promotion. It&#8217;s then $9 per month to include it in your Sling TV subscription, either Sling TV Blue or Sling TV Orange. (The colors refer to different tiers &#8211; Blue\\u00a0lets you stream on multiple devices at the same time, and has an expanded channel lineup.) The new Starz pack brings nearly 3,000 new titles to the service, Sling TV notes.<\\/p>\\n<p>In addition, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/news.sling.com\\/press-release\\/programming\\/sling-tv-becomes-college-football-destination-pac-12-networks\\\">Sling TV rolled out college sports feeds from Pac-12 Networks<\\/a> to both Sling Blue and Orange&#8217;s &#8220;Sports Extra&#8221; packs today.<\\/p>\\n<p>The company says that support for additional Windows 10 devices will arrive in the months ahead.

We pop open our favorite apps like Twitter or Imgur, and relax with a few scrolls or swipes.<\\/p>\\n<p>Wireless earbuds unlock this behavior for audio. Without the wires getting in the way, we&#8217;ll be more likely to leave them in our ears so they&#8217;re at the ready.

Apps designed to read you summaries of news articles would grow more ubiquitous. Authors might divide their works into shorter chapters. We could see more mini-songs like the twenty three-second Beatles track &#8220;Her Majesty&#8221;. \\u00a0And asynchronous voice clip messaging might replace some our daily texting.<\\/p>\\n<p>Down the line, simpler interaction with Siri and other apps through voice commands could emerge as the core value of AirPods. Right now, voice recognition is still a bit spotty. As it improves and we grow to rely on voice interfaces, more interactive short-form audio content could take off.

Indeed, such a person, does not, as a general rule, intervene in full knowledge of the consequences of his conduct in order to give customers access to a work illegally posted on the internet.<\\/p>\\n<p>In contrast, <strong>where it is established that such a person knew or ought to have known that the hyperlink he posted provides access to a work illegally published, for example owing to the fact that he was notified thereof by the copyright holders, the provision of that link constitutes a \\u2018communication to the public\\u2019<\\/strong>. The same applies if that link allows users to circumvent the restrictive measures taken by the site where the protected work is posted in order to restrict the public\\u2019s access to its own subscribers.<\\/p>\\n<p>Furthermore, <strong>when hyperlinks are posted for profit, it may be expected that the person who posted such a link should carry out the checks necessary to ensure that the work concerned is not illegally published<\\/strong>. Therefore, it must be presumed that that posting has been done with the full knowledge of the protected nature of the work and of the possible lack of the copyright holder\\u2019s consent to publication on the internet. <strong>In such circumstances, and in so far as that presumption is not rebutted, the act of posting a clickable link to a work illegally published on the internet constitutes a \\u2018communication to the public\\u2019<\\/strong><\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>As <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/fortune.com\\/2016\\/09\\/08\\/cjeu-hyperlinks-playboy\\/\\\">Fortune<\\/a> notes, the ruling is unusual in that it\\u00a0goes against the\\u00a0earlier opinion of the court&#8217;s advocate-general\\u00a0who back in April recommended that links to copyrighted material\\u00a0should not be considered a copyright breach themselves. AG opinions are usually highly influential on the CJEU &#8212; but in this instance the court has sought\\u00a0a third way, ruling\\u00a0that linking when unaware of copyright infringement and in a not-for-profit context is fine but adding a set of exceptions\\u00a0where a hyperlink\\u00a0could\\u00a0be considered\\u00a0a copyright breach in and of itself. It&#8217;s a ruling that threatens to complicate how copyright operates online\\u00a0in Europe by adding another lay of complexity.<\\/p>\\n<p>Most obviously the ruling\\u00a0could have substantial implications for search engine Google, whose core business involves\\u00a0hyperlinking to content hosted elsewhere. (In Europe the search engine\\u00a0has a more than 90 per cent share of the search engine market.) But the impact\\u00a0could potentially stretch to any for-profit online publisher which\\u00a0hyperlinks to others&#8217; content.\\u00a0Although it remains to be seen how broadly courts in EU Member State interpret the notion of posting a link for financial gain.<\\/p>\\n<p>Google publishes a <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.google.com\\/transparencyreport\\/removals\\/copyright\\/?hl=en#glance\\\">Transparency Report<\\/a>\\u00a0providing an ongoing tally\\u00a0of\\u00a0search result links that it has removed at the request of rights holders. This shows that in the past year it\\u00a0removed 832 million links to content on 342,000 websites. And while that&#8217;s already a very large number, all those instances involve Google responding to a takedown notice from a rights holder. By contrast the CJEU ruling appears to imply that for-profit entities such as Google might\\u00a0have a pre-emptive responsibility to check\\u00a0the legality of the content they are linking to before serving a hyperlink to a user\\u00a0&#8212; rather than waiting to receive a takedown notice. Which would be a huge shift.<\\/p>\\n<p>On the flip-side the ruling suggests that individuals who post links to pirated content online without knowing\\u00a0the content they are linking to is copyrighted and without doing so for their own financial gain would not be infringing copyright &#8212; with the court noting &#8220;it may prove difficult, in particular for individuals who wish to post such links, to ascertain whether the works involved are protected and, if necessary, whether the copyright holders of those works have consented to their publication on the internet&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>As it happens, the EU is also in the midst of reworking\\u00a0the region&#8217;s\\u00a0copyright law &#8212; with\\u00a0a\\u00a0proposed reform package due to be published later this month, on September 21.<\\/p>\\n<p>Late last month a leaked version of the EC&#8217;s copyright reform document suggested\\u00a0the Commission\\u00a0is planning to extend\\u00a0copyright protections to publishers &#8212; taking\\u00a0a similar\\u00a0approach to the\\u00a0German government which, back in 2014, backed a\\u00a0so-called <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2014\\/10\\/23\\/kapitulation\\/\\\">ancillary copyright law<\\/a> designed to cover the news snippets displayed in Google News.

In order to combat that, Airbnb is making several positive changes to the platform and its company policies, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky sent in an email to hosts and guests this morning.<\\/p>\\n<p>This includes\\u00a0guaranteeing short-term bookings for people who have been discriminated against, deemphasizing the use of user photos, blocking out availability if a host claims a space is taken when it really isn&#8217;t and working to increase the number of Instant Book listings, which don&#8217;t require hosts to approve specific guests, to one million by the beginning of 2017.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Discrimination is the opposite of belonging, and its existence on our platform jeopardizes this core mission,&#8221; Chesky wrote. &#8220;Bias and discrimination have no place on Airbnb, and we have zero tolerance for them. Unfortunately, we have been slow to address these problems, and for this I am sorry. I take responsibility for any pain or frustration this has caused members of our community. We will not only make this right; we will work to set an example that other companies can follow.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Airbnb&#8217;s issues with racism date back to at least late last year, when a <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/money.cnn.com\\/2015\\/12\\/11\\/technology\\/airbnb-bias-harvard\\/\\\">Harvard study<\\/a> showed that renters with black-sounding names\\u00a0were less likely to receive a booking through the site. Then, in June, an Airbnb host in North Carolina canceled a booking on a black person and sent her a slew of racist insults. Shortly after that incident,<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/06\\/01\\/airbnb-bans-racist-host\\/\\\">\\u00a0Chesky said that racism is not allowed on the platform<\\/a>\\u00a0and Airbnb\\u00a0permanently banned the host.<\\/p>\\n<p>Later that month, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/06\\/16\\/black-caucus-urges-airbnb-to-take-reports-of-racism-seriously\\/\\\">the Congressional Black Caucus urged Airbnb to take further action in addressing the issues of racism and discrimination on the company&#8217;s platform<\\/a>, citing how\\u00a0Title II of 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in places like hotels and motels on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin.<\\/p>\\n<p>Today, Laura Murphy, former head of the American Civil Liberties Union&#8217;s Washington D.C. office, laid out Airbnb&#8217;s game plan for tackling instances of racism and discrimination on the platform. Airbnb has been working with Murphy since June to ensure that the company is doing everything it can to\\u00a0fight racism.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Product and policy changes to eradicate racist behavior<\\/h2>\\n<p>In the 32-page document, Murphy details Airbnb&#8217;s commitment and plan to implement product and policy changes across\\u00a0eight\\u00a0areas.<\\/p>\\n<p>For one, starting Nov. 1, 2016, anyone who uses Airbnb will have to agree to a community commitment that entails treating fellow members with respect and without judgment and bias.\\u00a0Airbnb&#8217;s new <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.airbnb.com\\/help\\/article\\/483\\/what-is-airbnb-s-anti-discrimination-policy?topic=250\\\">non-discrimination policy<\\/a>, developed under the guidance of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/07\\/20\\/airbnb-hires-eric-holder\\/\\\">who joined Airbnb in July<\\/a>, prohibits content that promotes things like racism and bigotry.<\\/p>\\n<p>[related_articles]<\\/p>\\n<p>As part of the community commitment, Airbnb will build and release a feature by the first half of next year to\\u00a0address the instances of someone requesting a booking that was listed as vacant but then getting informed that it wasn&#8217;t available.\\u00a0Here&#8217;s a nugget from the report:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p>In some cases, it appears that these listings were then made available for\\u00a0the same trip to guests of a different race. Going forward, Airbnb will develop a\\u00a0feature to help prevent this from happening. If a host rejects a guest by stating that\\u00a0their space is not available, Airbnb will automatically block the calendar for\\u00a0subsequent reservation requests for that same trip.<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p><span style=\\\"line-height:1.625;\\\">Airbnb has also formed a team of\\u00a0engineers, data scientists, researchers and designers whose full-time jobs are to promote diversity and eradicate racism and bias from the Airbnb platform. One of the team&#8217;s first tasks will be experimenting with &#8220;reducing the prominence of guest photos in the booking process and enhancing other parts of host and guests profiles with objective information.&#8221;<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p>In the event that someone is discriminated against, Airbnb is committed to ensuring that the person finds a place to stay, even if it&#8217;s <em>not\\u00a0<\\/em>on Airbnb. For anyone who reported discrimination prior to today, Chesky said that Airbnb will help them book their next trip.<\\/p>\\n<p>Other changes include the addition of\\u00a0new flagging tools so that people can quickly report discrimination or hate speech. That tool will be expanded and enhanced by January 2017.\\u00a0Airbnb will also offer unconscious bias training for hosts. Once hosts complete the training, Airbnb will highlight them\\u00a0on the platform.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;These changes are merely a first step,&#8221; Murphy wrote in the report. &#8220;Airbnb understands that no one company can\\u00a0eliminate racism and discrimination. Fighting bias is an ongoing task that requires constant\\u00a0vigilance from all of us. And there is no question that we will continue to see examples of\\u00a0bias and discrimination in society, the sharing economy, and Airbnb in the future. As certain\\u00a0product tools are built and implemented, they will need to be refined and updated. The task\\u00a0of fighting discrimination is difficult, but Airbnb is committed to continuing this work in the\\u00a0future, and I will personally hold them to their word. We all should.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>The changes were developed in partnership with racial justice group Color of Change, Rainbow\\/PUSH Coalition, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP and others.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Diversity at Airbnb<\\/h2>\\n<p>Companywide, Airbnb is 46.3 percent female, 63 percent white, 7.1 percent Latino\\/a and 2.9 percent black in the U.S., <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.airbnb.com\\/creating-a-world-where-everyone-can-belong\\/\\\">according to its 2015\\u00a0diversity report<\\/a>.

That is, Uber riders can launch the app to see what stations their driver is playing, then sign into their own Pandora account, and change the tunes to their liking.<\\/p>\\n<p>This may seem like the sort of things that could irk drivers &#8211; after all, when the Spotify partnership was first announced, some were <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/uberpeople.net\\/threads\\/uber-spotify-partnership-slap-to-the-face-of-uberdrivers.7061\\/\\\">concerned<\\/a> that letting passengers choose the music would dehumanize the driver.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1382126\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/rider-music-pandora-marketing-gif-1.gif?w=680&#038;h=680\\\" alt=\\\"rider-music-pandora-marketing-gif-1\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"680\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>But on the flip side, many drivers today do\\u00a0ask passengers if the music is okay or if the rider would\\u00a0like to hear a different station, out of courtesy. By offering the ability to connect to Spotify or Pandora, the Uber app simply digitizes that switching experience, even if it doesn&#8217;t remove the need for the accompanying social niceties that are involved. (You know, it&#8217;s still nice to <em>ask first<\\/em>.)<\\/p>\\n<p>Pandora says that since its launch in the Uber driver app, drivers have played over 4 million hours of music &#8211; 60 million songs &#8211; and the most popular stations have been\\u00a0Drake, Future, Beyonc\\u00e9, Adele and Bruno Mars.<\\/p>\\n<p>To use the new feature on the rider side, you&#8217;ll need to be booked on a music-connected Uber. That means the driver\\u00a0has to have their phone connected via AUX, Bluetooth or USB; However, they don&#8217;t have to have their own linked Pandora account, nor do they need to be currently streaming music.<\\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1382152\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/ubermusic.png?w=680&#038;h=261\\\" alt=\\\"ubermusic\\\" width=\\\"680\\\" height=\\\"261\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p>When the driver is on the way, you&#8217;ll see the option appear to choose the music for your ride.

When you get in your car, your music will begin\\u00a0playing.<\\/p>\\n<p>This is also how a rider\\u00a0can choose to connect with a\\u00a0Spotify Premium account, as before.

IBM&#8217;s Power8 CPU features built-in support for the NVLink interface.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;This means database applications, high\\u00a0performance analytics applications, and high performance computing applications can operate on much\\u00a0larger data sets than possible in x86 systems with GPUs on the PCI-E interface,&#8221; IBM explains\\u00a0in today&#8217;s announcement.<\\/p>\\n<p><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/rack-close-up-of-ibm-power-systems-s822lc-for-high-performance-computing.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1381928\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\\/2016\\/09\\/rack-close-up-of-ibm-power-systems-s822lc-for-high-performance-computing.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\\\" alt=\\\"rack-close-up-of-ibm-power-systems-s822lc-for-high-performance-computing\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"683\\\" \\/><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>How much performance can you expect from this system? IBM says you can expect 21 teraflops of half-precision floating point performance from the GPUs &#8212; about 14 percent more than you would get from a card that&#8217;s plugged into a modern PCI-E slot. Given how long it takes to train a machine learning model, those numbers can quickly make a difference in real-world applications. IBM also says it&#8217;s seeing speed-ups of 2x or more over using the older Tesla K80 GPUs and PCI-E as the interconnect.<\\/p>\\n\"},\"excerpt\":{\"rendered\":\"<p>IBM today announced the launch of the aptly-named IBM Power Systems S822LC for High Performance Computing.

The round was led by Nauta Capital, with participation from existing backer Realiza. It brings total raised to $2 million, while I&#8217;m told the new financing will be used by Nextail to accelerate product development, and expand its sales and marketing efforts.<\\/p>\\n<p>Founded by Joaqu\\u00edn Villalba and Carlos Miragall in 2014, Nextail has developed a Software-as-a-Service that claims to bring artificial intelligence to physical retail inventory management. Its technology attempts to optimize the daily allocation and replenishment decisions that retailers have to make in order to ensure they hold the correct amount of stock at any point in time and can sell it at full price.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;The problem is retail\\u2019s billions of dollars in unsold inventory and markdowns because the goods were not in the right place at the right time,&#8221; explains Nextail&#8217;s Villalba. &#8220;In fashion, given the proliferation of styles, colors, and sizes, this problem is quite hard to crack&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Our product helps retailers extract the highest return from their stock investment, by placing the product in the stores where it will sell the fastest. To do so, we use fast fashion principles&#8230; coupled with the most advanced tech, such as machine learning or AI algorithms for image recognition&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>Furthermore, Villalba says Nextail&#8217;s product is proving to have a strong impact on a retailer&#8217;s bottom line. That&#8217;s because in fashion retail, profitability is driven by the percentage of goods that can be sold at full price rather through discounting, which is typically used shift unwanted stock.<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Thanks to our fast fashion optimization algorithms that leverage machine learning, massive computation in the cloud, and collaborative decision-making, we are able to solve this, resulting in increased amounts sold at full price and reduced inventories at the same time. Our clients love our product because it basically enables them to sell more, at better prices, using less stock,&#8221; he adds.<\\/p>\\n<p>Nextail&#8217;s typical customers are fashion retailers with 100-1,000 stores, with buy-in coming from CEOs, heads of retail, store managers, and area managers, to the teams on the ground actually dealing with inventory allocation and replenishment.

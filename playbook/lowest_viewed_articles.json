Altogether, it has raised\u00a0$222 million\u00a0from investors\u00a0and, according to Recode, it generated revenue of $300 million last year. (A\u00a0three-month-old\u00a0Bloomberg report said its sales last year were $275 million.)\nA source tells us that the vast majority of the Honest Company\u2019s\u00a0revenue is\u00a0being\u00a0generated via the company\u2019s sites, but that\u00a0it\u2019s currently seeing its fastest growth\u00a0by selling wholesale through more than 6,000 stores, including Target, Whole Foods, Costco and, until\u00a0recently, through its own L.A.-based pop-up store at the city\u2019s shopping center,\u00a0The Grove.\nThat store closed on July 28. It should be noted that pop-up stores have a limited run by design.\nIn June, Bloomberg reported that\u00a0Honest was prepping \u201cslowly\u201d for an IPO, following a report in Bloomberg in February that said Honest was working with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on a public offering.\nHonest makes both home products and cosmetics, including a new hair care line. Its next area of focus will apparently be on a line-up of nail-related items.\nWe sat down with Alba and Honest\u2019s chief marketing officer Chris Thorne at\u00a0our New York Disrupt conference in May, where we discussed the company\u2019s growth, along with several lawsuits that have been filed against it, including a\u00a0class action lawsuit that was filed last year, claiming its sunscreen\u00a0product didn\u2019t work, and a newer suit that alleges its organic baby formula includes 11 \u201csynthetic substances that are not allowed in organic products.\u201d\nThorne said then that Honest Company takes customer service issues seriously. He also said that while the company supports consumer advocacy groups, Honest \u201coften gets involved in the discussion because we bring a name, Jessica\u2019s name, and that brings a lot of attention to an issue, and it\u2019s a smart strategy for  but unfortunate for us, because we do get brought into these.\u201d\nAs for those reported discussions with bankers, Thorne said that Honest \u201cconstantly talks to advisors and banks to stay up to date on trends and competitors,\u201d adding, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary there.\u201d\nE-commerce first companies have been a hot commodity of late, as traditional retailers look for ways to remain relevant to younger consumers. Early last month, Walmart announced plans to acquire the online retailer Jet for $3.3 billion in cash and stock. In July, the online grooming startup Dollar Shave Club was sold to the consumer giant Unilever for $1 billion.\nNewer businesses\u00a0that cater largely to female shoppers have also become attractive acquisition candidates.\u00a0In July, for example, IT Cosmetics, an eight-year-old, Jersey City, N.J.-based company that makes 300 skin-care and make-up products, was sold to L\u2019Oreal for $1.2 billion in cash.","date":"2016-09-09T11:55:00","id":1382820,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/confirmed-honest-company-in-talks-to-sell\/","slug":"confirmed-honest-company-in-talks-to-sell","tags":[33663,977,6877,71123637],"title.rendered":"Confirmed: Honest Company in talks to\u00a0sell","views":12181},{"index":47,"author":39990176,"categories":[1342,4328,449223024,17396],"content.rendered":"The Raspberry Pi Foundation has finally put out\u00a0an official starter kit for its low cost microcomputer \u2014 offering what it dubs\u00a0an\u00a0\u201cunashamedly premium\u201d bundle for the\u00a0Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, complete with optical mouse and keyboard in a very Apple-looking shade of white, plus\u00a0all the cables you need to get\u00a0up and running. The only thing missing is a screen.\nThe official Pi starter kit is available to order online in the U.K. from the Foundation\u2019s distributors\u00a0element14 and RS Components, priced at \u00a399 (+VAT). While sales are slated to\u00a0open up\u00a0to markets in the rest of the world\u00a0\u201cover the next few weeks\u201d.\u00a0It\u2019s something of a full revolution for the Foundation which conceived the original Pi with the intention of inspiring schoolkids to learn programming the hard way \u2014 i.e. by trial and error and messing around with wires and cables, rather than being handed\u00a0an \u2018it just works box of bits\u2019 to plug and play.\nFour and a half years later, with more than 10 million of its single board Pi microcomputers now sold, the Foundation evidently feels it\u2019s time to put a cherry on top of the project with its own shiny white starter kit. And fair play to them.\u00a0In February last year the Pi had racked up 5 million unit sales. But the expansion of the range to the $5 price-point with Pi Zero\u00a0last November has clearly helped accelerate demand.\nThe project has also scaled wildly beyond the Foundation\u2019s\u00a0original goals, with\u00a0many a Pi finding\u00a0its way into the hands of a crafty maker or clever startup, not just\u00a0aspiring student coders. So the market for Pi will surely accommodate a premium bundle likely to\u00a0appeal to\u00a0gizmo lovers\u00a0in the Western world, while continuing to\u00a0support expanding access to computing in developing markets via the Foundation\u2019s\u00a0most affordable Pis.\nThe Foundation is\u00a0by no means the first to offer a Pi starter kit. Indeed, the lack of an official kit provided a window of opportunity for third parties\u00a0to put together Pi bundles of their own, such as London-based startup Kano which offers a bundle aimed at kids that includes not just hardware bits but its own software skin\u00a0running atop the Pi\u2019s OS with gamified elements. So while the arrival of an official kit may now squeeze out some players, there\u2019s likely to continue to be room for a range of specialized\u00a0starter kits targeting different niches.\nThe full list of items included in the official Pi starter kit is as follows:\n\nA Raspberry Pi 3 Model B\nAn 8GB NOOBS SD card\nAn official case\nAn official 2.5A multi-region power supply\nAn official 1m HDMI cable\nAn optical mouse and a keyboard with high-quality scissor-switch action\nA copy of Adventures in Raspberry Pi Foundation Edition","date":"2016-09-09T04:54:44","id":1382701,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/09\/raspberry-pi-finally-offers-an-official-starter-kit-after-passing-10m-sales\/","slug":"raspberry-pi-finally-offers-an-official-starter-kit-after-passing-10m-sales","tags":[1382984,2428084,1896567,49695267,56661568],"title.rendered":"Raspberry Pi finally offers an official starter kit after passing 10M\u00a0sales","views":14896},{"index":89,"author":5302483,"categories":[1559,17396],"content.rendered":"The speaker that speaks might soon speak without you speaking to ask it to speak. Amazon\u2019s Echo is set to get push notifications, according to The Information, which would allow it to give you a heads up about activity from its connected services, so it could, for example, tell you when your connected doorbell rings or pipe up and tell you when a loved one\u2019s flight has landed.\nCurrently, Echo only speaks when spoken to; a user has to use the activation word \u201cAlexa\u201d to prompt it to begin listening for a command or request, and then it\u2019ll respond to said input with its own vocal response. Alexa hasn\u2019t supported the ability to provide any kind of audio notice unprompted as a result of data it receives from a user\u2019s connected services \u2013 the closest it comes is being able to sound an alert based on an alarm or timer.\nEcho has both audio and visual capabilities, thanks to a light ring that surrounds its upper edge, and The Information suggests Amazon could allow developers access to both for push notifications, so that users can choose how much of an intrusion said notices provide.\nAlexa is also a service that exists unbound from the Echo hardware itself, and it\u2019s very possible than any push notification support would extend to other hardware that uses the Alexa API, including the Nucleus smart intercom. The Information says the use of push notices would be part of a larger plan to give developers more control of third-party apps and gadgets overall via Echo and Alexa.\nNotifications will be a tricky thing to get right on Echo, since a push alert with voice in a device with no display is a very different thing from a subtle vibration or screen-based alert on a smartphone. Still, it\u2019s a feature that could do very well provided the user has total and intuitive control over when they\u2019re alerted, and how.","date":"2016-09-08T07:30:42","id":1382169,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/amazon-echo-could-soon-start-talking-to-you-unprompted\/","slug":"amazon-echo-could-soon-start-talking-to-you-unprompted","tags":[6602,295600149],"title.rendered":"Amazon Echo could soon start talking to you\u00a0unprompted","views":19095},{"index":80,"author":2414667,"categories":[3457,20429,17396],"content.rendered":"Need to post content to multiple social networks at the same time? A new chatbot called Yala\u00a0wants to\u00a0help. The bot, live now on Slack with Facebook Messenger support coming soon, not only does the work of posting for you, it\u2019s also intelligent enough to know when to post. That is, Yala\u00a0uses algorithms and machine learning to determine the best time to post in order to increase your exposure and receive better engagement on the items you\u2019re sharing.\nThe idea for the bot comes from Gary Levitt, who previously sold his email marketing startup Mad Mimi to GoDaddy back in 2014. Afterwards, he attempted to enter the e-commerce space with\u00a0an online storefront service\u00a0Pinecone, but says he had trouble getting it off the ground. That led to the pivot to Yala instead \u2013 something that addressed a problem Levitt faced himself while building Pinecone.\n\u201cI was dissatisfied with Buffer, and its less impressive competitors, because multi-channel posting took time,\u201d explains Levitt, \u201cespecially when it came to scheduling across many channels, editing, choosing times and composing,\u201d he says.\nBuffer, by way of background, is a social media scheduling service, which also offers tools that help you determine the best time to publish.\nHowever, with Yala, the idea is to bring a similar sort of intelligence a bit \u201ccloser to home,\u201d says Levitt \u2013 meaning, Slack.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382286-2 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382286-2 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382286-2 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1382286-2 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nTo determine the best time to post, Yala looks at your social media posting history to determine which times and posts led to the most shares, likes and clicks. It also takes into account things like time zones and other audience behaviors. Plus, the machine learning aspect enables it to improve and automatically correct itself on the fly, given your own social media engagement metrics.\nBy being able to identify patterns, it\u2019s able to create a posting schedule that refines itself in real-time, Levitt says.\nThe team\u00a0saw\u00a0a 10 percent increase in shares and posts when they used Yala, during testing. (Yala, in case you\u2019re curious, is a slang term in Israel, borrowed from Arabic, which means \u201cget a move on.\u201d)\nCurrently, the bot works with Facebook and Twitter, and is live on Slack. Additional platforms and social networks are in development now.\nYala is a bootstrapped team of three, and is based in both New York and Israel.","date":"2016-09-08T09:07:23","id":1382286,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/yalas-new-chatbot-knows-the-best-time-to-post-to-social-networks\/","slug":"yalas-new-chatbot-knows-the-best-time-to-post-to-social-networks","tags":[175,49818],"title.rendered":"Yala\u2019s new chatbot knows the best time to post to social\u00a0networks","views":22487},{"index":30,"author":2414667,"categories":[4213,17396],"content.rendered":"Too lazy to read your tweets? Now, Amazon Alexa can just read them to you instead. Yes, that\u2019s right: Twitter today has launched an app for Amazon\u2019s voice platform Alexa, which means you can listen to the latest from Twitter right on your Echo speaker or other Alexa-powered device. The new app can give you general information on trends, or deliver information from your own account, says Twitter.\nAccording to the app\u2019s description (or its \u201cSkill\u2019s description, in Amazon parlance), you\u2019ll need to authenticate with your Twitter account in order to get started.\nAfterwards, you can launch the app by saying \u201cAlexa, open Twitter.\u201d\nThe virtual assistant\u00a0can then read your home Timeline to you, as well as your Mentions, Retweets, and Likes. As with other Alexa Skills, you\u2019ll have to learn how to ask for these items, by saying things like \u201cAlexa, ask Twitter for my own tweets,\u201d \u201cAlexa, ask Twitter has anyone retweeted me?,\u201d \u201cAlexa, ask Twitter for my Mentions,\u201d \u201cAlexa, ask Twitter what is happening?\u201d and so on.\nIn addition, the app can provide more general information from Twitter\u2019s service, like the current trends or the local trends \u2014 meaning, trends for your particular location (e.g. \u201cAlexa, ask Twitter for trends in Seattle\u201d).\n\nNone of this seems to be a particularly efficient way to consume the rapid-fire information that\u2019s published to Twitter\u2019s network, but the fact that Twitter felt compelled to launch an app on Alexa speaks to the growing importance of Amazon\u2019s voice computing platform in consumer\u2019s lives. As of June, Amazon said there were\u00a0tens of thousands of developers working on Skills for Alexa, whose app store\u00a0had\u00a0grown to house over 1,400 of these add-ons.\nOf course, we all wish that Twitter was spending its time building a feature that would let us edit our tweets, instead of rolling out things like Read Receipts for messages (the horror!)\u00a0or new ways to hear our tweets read aloud, but I guess Alexa was a box\u00a0the company felt the need to check.\nYou can switch on the new Twitter Skill in the Alexa app on mobile or web, then authorize it\u00a0to access your Twitter account.\n\n\nNew on Amazon Alexa!

The popularity contest that has become the election is diluting our time, attention and ability to think critically. Which is ironic, given that we are more connected to information than we have ever been before, and the computation necessary to model problems has never been cheaper.\nThe only certainty in the election is that the results will have a dramatic impact on all citizens, businesses and organizations around the world. With war raging across continents, inaction in the face of climate change and the disparity of wealth threatening the stability of the economy and open flow of invention, an easy solution would be to point fingers and place blame.\nWhat we really need to do is rise to the greater level of civic duty that our culture needs to govern our increasingly complex world. We need to be more involved and have an actual say in how we are governed. For that reason, I am giving my company November 8th off to remove any impediments from their ability to vote.\nI grew up in New York,\u00a0but I was born in Morocco. My grandfather, along with his brother and Allal al-Fassi, started the first political party in Morocco. I grew up admiring him as one of the founding fathers of modern politics in his country. I was raised with a real sense of civics, which I saw in action whenever we would visit Fez.\nInterestingly, Morocco was the first country to publicly recognize the United States as an official state with the ratification of the Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship in 1786. Signed by Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, it recognized Moroccan ports as open to U.S. ships and is the longest-standing unbroken treaty relationship in U.S. history.\nI am inspired by this history of diplomacy and always feel it important to be civic-minded. The commitment to make the world we live in one where countries and peoples are bound by productive relationships and trade is one of the driving forces as to why I\u2019m an entrepreneur today. These early experiences also meaningfully impacted the kind of company I founded, the type of work we do and the team we recruit to be a part of, and contribute to, our bigger vision.\nAgain, I am encouraging these core values at Enigma by declaring November 8th a mandatory holiday. True, some people can\u2019t legally vote and perhaps some will abstain, but one thing is certain \u2014 they can\u2019t come in to work.\nWhy? I am trying to remove any ounce of guilt that could be felt by a single team member for missing a meeting, a client call or any other professional activity because they wanted to vote. Most, I expect, will spend at least part of the day focused on their role in the future of American society and the world \u2014 and that\u2019s time well spent.\nI sit at an intersection of culture, identity, race and religion that made the U.S. the only place where I could earn the trust and opportunities that I have.\n\u00a0\nI feel so much gratitude to have founded a company where not only can we afford to make such decisions, but where we all feel that this is simply the right thing to do. With voter disenfranchisement issues still plaguing the citizenry, and many burdened by plight and diminishing wages, often working multiple jobs to make ends meet, we need to lead everywhere we can. We need to make a point about how important it is to care about everyone\u2019s voice in this process.\nMy biggest motivation is to respect the importance of being involved in the civic duties that are needed to protect the unique environment of the U.S. for entrepreneurs like myself. As a Muslim naturalized citizen of the U.S., married to a half-French, half-American Jewish woman with a two-year-old who holds three passports, I can assure you I sit at an intersection of culture, identity, race and religion that made the U.S. the only place where I could earn the trust and opportunities that I have. The opportunity to get a great education, the freedom from judgment by others and the support I needed to dream big \u2014 these are sanctities that I\u2019ve uniquely felt in the U.S. throughout my life. The U.S. is the only business environment where I would be able to run the company I do, the way I have.\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one; 49 percent of entrepreneurs funded by the venture capital community are first- or second-generation immigrants. Inherently, these people are risk-takers; they don\u2019t only represent the tail end of the American Dream, they\u2019re the beginning of it. They\u2019re uniquely resourceful, they get their bearings and are strong enough to build, rebuild and build again. Finally, they are grateful for the freedom and justice in the United States we have all fought so diligently to preserve and cultivate. Let\u2019s not let this election threaten the openness of our society by remaining complacent in the face of several policies rooted in fear that could threaten our growth.\n\nAt Enigma, we focus on solving operational problems with data in the real world. That puts policy and regulation in the forefront of our minds. The very least we can do is rise up to the minimum requirement of voting for our president every four years.\nThere is power in data, but it only helps us interpret the world when the point is to better it. I encourage you and your teams to join me and ensure that everyone who is entrusted with the right to vote wakes up on November 8th\u00a0ready to stand up for a society that enables ingenuity and global transformation.","date":"2016-09-10T22:00:09","id":1380178,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/why-im-giving-my-company-election-day-off\/","slug":"why-im-giving-my-company-election-day-off","tags":[5648,331649,16799],"title.rendered":"Why I\u2019m giving my company Election Day\u00a0off","views":44588},{"index":95,"author":699688,"categories":[449223024],"content.rendered":"If I were Amazon, I would definitely lead with the whole $90 bit. Granted, there are a few key upgrades to talk about here, but price point has always been a major selling point for Amazon devices (thanks in no small part to the fact that it makes most of its money on content), and it\u2019s pretty tough to argue with a sub-$100 price point.\nJust under a year after receiving its last meaningful upgrade, Amazon is refreshing\u00a0the Fire HD 8 in a handful of ways, starting with the addition of Alexa functionality to the dirt-cheap slate, making this the first of its Fire tablets to get Amazon\u2019s own voice assistant, surprisingly enough. Users will be able to listen to music, get news, check the weather and more by talking into the tablet.\nSome key upgrades on the specs front, as well. The new Fire gets a larger 4,750 mAh battery, which promises up to twelve hours of life on a charge. RAM has been upgraded (though it\u2019s only at a paltry 1.5GB now) and storage has been doubled to either 16- or 32GB \u2013 not a ton, but you can upgrade that pretty substantially by way of a microSD slot.\nThe eight-inch display certainly isn\u2019t Amazon\u2019s best with a 1280 x 800 resolution that works out to 189ppi. Of course that comes with the same caveat as the rest of the specs \u2013 this is a $90 tablet we\u2019re talking about here.\nThe tablet runs Fire OS 5, the latest version of Amazon\u2019s Android-based, content focused mobile OS and features your standard selection of Fire mainstays, like X-Ray, ASAP and Second Screen.\nThe new tablet is up for pre-order today, starting at $90 for the 16GB model.

That\u2019s why Signifyd created technology that assesses a transaction risk before the card is processed.\nThe San Jose-based company is raising $19 million in financing for its fraud protection services. Investors include Menlo Ventures, TriplePoint Capital and American Express Ventures.\nMany e-commerce businesses do not have the resources to screen for risky transactions, so Signifyd\u2019s financial guarantee has allowed them to secure clients like Jet.com, Lacoste, and Peet\u2019s coffee. Signifyd says it has developed machine learning capabilities that are accurate enough for them to feel confident reimbursing the merchant on the rare occasions when its predictive technology is wrong.\nSignifyd\u2019s platform uses \u201cthousands of different data points to make a decision,\u201d CEO Raj Ramanand tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe pay out 100% if we make a mistake.\u201d\nThe company\u00a0typically charges clients up to 1% of transaction revenue, but the company estimates they save clients much more. \u201cMost customers see a huge increase in their margins,\u201d Ramanand insists, estimating that merchants end up declining about 3-5% of good revenue when they aren\u2019t able to accurately assess whether a purchase is criminal.\n\nPravin Vazirani, managing director at Menlo Ventures, says that \u201cwe\u2019ve been investors in various e-commerce companies and so we definitely felt like we had some strong insight into how big a problem this is.\u201d\nTim Eades, CEO at vArmour, sits on the board at Signifyd and told us he believes in the company because it provides a quicker solution than other alternatives. \u201cThe majority of the market is just taken up by old tech. With Signifyd, you have a one minute product.\u201d\nSignifyd has previously raised over $30 million from investors including Data Collective and Andreessen Horowitz.","date":"2016-09-08T10:09:17","id":1382379,"link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/08\/signifyd-raises-19-million-to-help-with-online-fraud-protection\/","slug":"signifyd-raises-19-million-to-help-with-online-fraud-protection","tags":[9881,27320,131839663],"title.rendered":"Signifyd raises $19 million to help with online fraud\u00a0protection","views":46847}]
